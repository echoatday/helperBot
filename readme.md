## The Helper

This is a simple discord bot I'm working on mostly for fun. It started with the ^time command, to convert a date/time string into discord's unix time tag. When you talk to folks in New Zealand, time zones are a lot of work. The Helper and its conversational text are references to Feast for a King, an adult only webcomic. (https://feastforaking.com)
