## The Helper

This is a simple discord bot I'm working on mostly for fun. It started with the !time command, to convert a date/time string into discord's unix time tag. When talk to folks in New Zealand, time zones are a lot of work. The !hello command is a reference to Feast for a King, an adult-only webcomic.

#### Changelog

- v0.1: Bot is functioning. Added !time, !roll, and !hello.
