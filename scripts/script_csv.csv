name,line
crimson,i have to be careful
crimson,now is really not the time to be distracted 
crimson,but it hurts
crimson,hurt me because im wrong
crimson,because i cant ever understand
crimson,that's what you're supposed to do to scary monsters
helper,"silly crimson, you're not a monster. you're just a worm."
crimson,i am nothing
crimson,i am your nothing
crimson,yours.
helper,"pardon me? ""yours"""
helper,yours? darling
helper,"would you please care to explain all this ""your"" bullshit? hmmm?"
helper,"because, oh let's see.. last i checked you are mine! or have you forgotten me so. easily?!"
crimson,what?! why you
crimson,honey
crimson,do we have to do this now?
crimson,im sort of in the middle of getting seriously laid right now thanks.
helper,"i know! you are always getting ""seriously laid"""
helper,when do i ever have a minute alone with you to talk when you're constantly shoving yourself into something soft and squishy?!
crimson,shut up. 
crimson,i am not that bad.
helper,yes you are!
crimson,i am no-
crimson,sigh. 
crimson,look. i mean it
crimson,im really not in the mood for this
crimson,dont worry about that stuff i thought
crimson,i was just caught up in the moment
crimson,and that moment is almost over
crimson,so i want to be there while it lasts
crimson,please honey? 
crimson,i'll make it up to youu
crimson,gimme back my eyeee
helper,"no. being cute doesnt just get you what you want, crimson."
crimson,yes it doooess
helper,oh. right. excuse me of course it does
helper,so you do want to kill that worm?
crimson,no but 
crimson,she's so happy
helper,of course she's happy! 
helper,she's coming her fucking brains out!
helper,"wait, does she even have brains?"
helper,"i dunno. she's got that weird head-mouth thing with a tongue so, guess not?"
helper,it all makes sense now.
helper,unbelievable.
helper,i know. worms.
crimson,its not like that! 
crimson,"i mean, part of it still is of course, but"
crimson,"there's so much more to it, ok? what she said to me"
helper,"wow crimson, do you really think this is some deep emotional bonding thing and not just a hot desperate fuck?"
helper,the only part that was deep was how far you were shoving your own worm tentacle down your throat.
helper,yeah. how touching.
helper,face it - dylan is simply thrilled to be free of all her problems and responsibilities. she's running away.
helper,now - running away! that's something both of you could really bond over if she'd even care to ask!
helper,but she wont. because she doesnt care about you at all.
helper,she doesnt ever want to either. she just wants to use you.
helper,and you're ok with being treated like that?
crimson,sure why not. 
crimson,happens all the time
helper,but. you. dont. want. to. ahem. kill. her.
helper,"im fine with you fucking, killing, blah blah blah... whatever, babe. but. being used to do something like eat someone when your heart's not 100% ok with it? uh-uh. trouble."
helper,you don't need no pity fuck'n'feast on your plate of issues. 
helper,see how things arent exactly fitting here?
helper,"see? get it? im trying to do that - scissoring hand pose cause you're screwing right now, hehe."
helper,"oh wait, right. dick mode right now"
helper,ugh.. dicks ruin all the fun.
crimson,she gave herself to me
crimson,i told her i understood that i would help her
crimson,what she wants isn't gross or wrong its what our species does
crimson,and she chose me!
crimson,"you think i could just say ""no""?! are you kidding?!"
crimson,i couldnt do that to her!
helper,"you gotta, bitch."
crimson,i cant
helper,listen to me. you have to.
helper,"its not your damn job to be the ""proof"" she wants for any~thing, darling."
helper,dont you force yourself to carry that emotional burden and guilt for her. 
helper,"she wouldn't do jack shit for you. she doesnt even care about your feelings over it, either."
helper,"but i do care. and i want to help you, crimson!"
helper,and like... honey. just look at yourself. you're an absolute mess here.
helper,"what part of you really thinks this is in any way a good idea, hm?"
crimson,"i never said it was ""good"""
helper,see? then dont do it.
crimson,i cant!
crimson,you know its not that simple. 
crimson,"there are no ""good"" options"
helper,sooo you're going to just go with hers?
helper,her amazing plan that's got you backed into an emotional corner?
helper,you're picking her over you in this situation you didn't ask for at all? right.
helper,dylan didnt have to do this. there are other options.
helper,"she stabbed herself so she wouldnt get eaten, and wow. now she wants you to do that to her?"
helper,sounds like she has no fucking clue what she wants. i bet she'd even change her mind again. or at any given moment!
crimson,its too late
crimson,i accepted her
crimson,i cant turn back now
crimson,she has no chance for survival
helper,if she dies then she dies! you dont have to be the one to murder her.
helper,honestly. serves her right for making such poor choices
helper,"by the way, you still have time, sugar."
helper,you can try to figure out something so dont give me that excuse.
helper,if she blames you for changing your mind and resists the offer of help? umm.
helper,forgettt it!
helper,she wouldn't be worth the grief you'd be putting yourself through anyway!
helper,is it really the worst thing to hurt her little fucking feelings when you'd be saving her life?
helper,ooh noo! she might just hate you foreverrrr for not doing what she wanted! and if that's what happens?
helper,that's life
helper,"dylan might have given you her life to ""take"" but its not really ever ""yours"" crimson."
crimson,"im already taking it, celadon!"
helper,"sugar, we all know how skilled you are at it but right now, you're giving it."
helper,you're giving it to her hard. and you're going to give her life back too.
helper,give it to her so good she wont ever want to miss out on it. for. anything.
helper,make all of her pain worth every goddamn second. make it all worth going through more just to be with you. even for one glimpse of a moment longer
helper,is death the one controlling your cock right now? i don't think so.
helper,then why would you let it be the one thing that will satisfy her?
helper,make it you crimson!
helper,fuck death
helper,dont let death have any god damn mercy!
helper,now. that's my worm.
crimson,yours
helper,"dont you get all gay on me, crimson."
helper,you know i hate it when you worms get like that
crimson,but i like being gay
helper,ughh dont say that gross shit around me!
crimson,too bad. one of my favorite hobbies just happens to be pissing off my bossy triangle wife
helper,well you're certainly very good at it lately.
crimson,"im sorry, love"
helper,it used to be so cute. watching you chase after anyone who reminded you of me.
helper,however. you're loosing your touch. these choices are starting to get downright insulting.
helper,"its getting old, sweetie."
helper,you'll never be able to replace me so why are you even trying to? you can still talk to me anytime.
crimson,im not! i wouldnt ever
crimson,its just so hard
crimson,it doesnt matter where i go or what i do
crimson,i see you in everything. everyone
crimson,id give anything just to hear your voice say my name again
helper,ew.
helper,you're so desperate. i think its even getting worse.
helper,very unattractive.
crimson,"golly. you're sweet to me, pumpkin"
crimson,i wonder why we dont chat as much anymore
helper,i cannot believe you'd just blatantly admit to avoiding me.
crimson,whoops. how did i ever let that one slip?
crimson,gosh here let me try to figure that out hmm
crimson,might take a while because im so fucking stupid 
crimson,and you're the genius with a million secrets 
crimson,who doesnt trust me with any of them!
helper,"oh, im surprised you understand that much!"
crimson,oh no. i dont. 
crimson,"even after all this time we've spent together, all our history"
crimson,i still doubt that i actually know a single thing about you
helper,"my darling red spaghetti, give yourself more credit! tsk."
helper,you know one or two.
helper,its not my fault i have to repeat things constantly. only for you to always forget them!
helper,"how are we ever going to make progress with you like that, hmm?"
helper,you cant keep up with me. who do you think is to blame for that?
crimson,"you're more problem here than i am, celadon."
crimson,you know absolutely everything about me and my whole life
crimson,you can hear all my fucking thoughts
crimson,feel all of my emotions
crimson,yet you still just say and do things that will really upset me!
crimson,if you can predict everything i fucking say
crimson,you could just fix our issues
crimson,but you dont
crimson,you refuse to change your methods at all.
crimson,you treat me like a little pet worm!
crimson,not someone you care so much about
helper,and i take such good care of my little pet! in the way you like best!
helper,as i've said countless times before - i'll change as soon as you do.
helper,"im only behaving how you want me to, dum dum."
helper,"if you dont really like it this way, pick something else!"
crimson,you fucking shitty evil triangle alien motherfucker
crimson,i hate you!
helper,ahahaha! i dont even need to read your thoughts to know that's bullshit!
helper,"there there, my masochistic baby pop - you'll get there somedayy."
helper,just kidding. you'll always love me!
helper,"i know worms of all kinds have a strong, innate sense of loyalty to those they've given it to."
helper,"by nature, you're a very emotionally driven creature. however - you take compassion and dedication to the most extreme levels!"
helper,"there's no end to your love, or what you would sacrafice to help others.. even creatures that aren't like you!"
helper,you fight for whats best for everyone! everything - even what you dont understand! even your enemies!
helper,such a shame you cant actually seem to accomplish anything you want! or have anyone notice your incredible efforts and perseverance! ahahaha!
helper,you're just an altruistic with a martyr complex who just wants to be understooood~ and get some validation!
helper,"not that you actually need those things, silly!"
helper,what you do need is some serious help!
helper,"pssst, that's~ why~ im~ here, you're welcome!"
crimson,fuck yoou
crimson,i dont need or want your help!
crimson,all you do again and again is emotionally abuse me 
crimson,"because you claim you ""dont understand"" pain and emotions "
crimson,and then always expect me to forgive you and teach you about them because im the only one you trust to understand you!
crimson,but you arent improving you're only getting worse! and scarier! 
crimson,then you tell me its my responsibility
crimson,well guess what! its not! its yours! 
crimson,i dont deserve to be treated like this anymore! 
crimson,its not fair or good for either of us!
crimson,i dont care how special or smart or alone you are
crimson,i want out of this fucking endless nightmare!
crimson,im not equipped to handle this! 
crimson,i dont care if you're always the one right about things!
crimson,the way you treat me will always be wrong!
crimson,"i really thought i could help you, celadon! "
crimson,but it turns out that i cant! i failed! 
crimson,and you failed to give a single fucking shit about me!
crimson,im sorry i was so damn naive to think you could care! 
crimson,what a mistake that was! wow!
crimson,so go find your fucking flying saucer and go bother someone else before this shit gets any worse!
crimson,do you hear me?! its absolutely over! 
crimson,now leave! me! the fuck! alone!
helper,"but, you said you loved me!"
crimson,yeah. well. 
crimson,its incredible to me that you still dont get that i do. 
crimson,that i only wished what's best for you.
crimson,you're just a lost alien 
crimson,i thought i could take care of you and make you happy
crimson,but i projected too much empathy
crimson,clung to too much hope.
crimson,i cant love something that wont love me back.
crimson,we just dont understand each other. im not the one who is best for you.
crimson,this isnt healthy for anyone
crimson,its not going to work out like this.
crimson,i refuse to allow this sort of messed up relationship to continue.
crimson,i gotta love me more than i love you
crimson,"maybe then you'll understand or.. i dont know, i give up."
crimson,but i do know you'll be absolutely fine without me. you dont need me to survive.
crimson,"good luck. and goodbye, celadon. i hope you'll find what you're looking for."
helper,"ooh honey.. you're always so close to doing things correctly, arent you?"
crimson,"there is no ""correct."" there's only just options you choose. "
crimson,that one happened to be mine.
crimson,i dont regret what i said or meant then!
crimson,im sick of being dragged through memory lesson-fucking lane!
crimson,"let me go back to dylan! release me, celadon!"
crimson,its my body - not yours! 
crimson,youre not even fucking real!
helper,oho~!
helper,is-is that- could it be?! a glimmer of that old fire in you? is it really true?
helper,i knew you liked that worm!
helper,finally - some actual motivation for you to improve!
helper,im helping!
crimson,no! no you're not! 
crimson,you dont get any credit for this! im the one helping myself here!
crimson,no! no! stop it!
crimson,you dont get to touch or kiss me anymore! 
crimson,do you understand?!
helper,oh darling! you're doing so well!
helper,"you're really standing up for yourself! and to me, even! keep going, keep going!"
crimson,no!
crimson,you're just some fucked up hallucination of guilt or something!
crimson,maybe an extraterrestrial disease?
crimson,"whatever it fucking is, i dont give a shit!"
crimson,"whatever you ""really"" are"
crimson,it doesn't change that you're fucking dead celadon!
crimson,i regret ever meeting you
crimson,all i want is some peace so i can actually try to heal from all the damage you've done to me!
crimson,and how dare
crimson,how dare you take dylan's fate hostage just to force me to confront you more!
crimson,i dont need fixing! its you! you dont doubt or regret any of your actions!
crimson,you will never have the right to do this to me! its torture!
crimson,"i need space, especially inside my own goddamn fucking mind!"
crimson,i need to get back to dylan!
crimson,you cant keep me from her caged like this
crimson,i wont let you!
helper,huh?
helper,ohh! where are you running off to now?
crimson,dylan!
crimson,what?
crimson,hey!
crimson,shit!
crimson,hang on! i got you!
crimson,um

crimson,"thanks, smartass"
crimson,"wait, that symbol on their weird looking uniform"
crimson,its the tricend airforce!

crimson,interesting
crimson,where's your ship?
helper,right here of course!
crimson,is something wrong?

helper,"oh, hello again! have you brought the seeds?"
crimson,where's your ship
helper,"huh? but - if i am not mistaken, i already told you!"
crimson,specifically.
helper,"oh, in that case, it is ""located"" in my mind! is that more clear?"
helper,"in other words, it is conjured by my thoughts!"
crimson,"so this ""ship"" of yours isnt actually made of metal"
helper,may i please continue my meal?
crimson,are you even part of tricend?
helper,what is tricend?
galore,whats the hold up?! 
galore,let's get to fucking!
helper,"oh! i apologize! am i, perhaps, interrupting a courting ritual?"
helper,"ah! i see now! the ""delicious seed!"" could that be a metaphor? how creative!"
helper,so this is your potential mating partner? please don't let me intrude!
crimson,no
crimson,it is not.
helper,it isn't? 
crimson,no. never.
helper,"oh, my mistake!"
crimson,im sure you're probably a very lovely walking crotch for your species but im not interested. thanks.
galore,uh
crimson,have a nice day bye
galore,uh
helper,"i wish you luck on your goals of fornication and proper ""seed"" collecting!"
galore,"you cant reject me, human! that only makes me want you mooorre!"
galore,it hurts
helper,why does it hurt? are you injured?
galore,i just shat out my own guts
helper,why'd you do that?
galore,i dont know
galore,being rejected just hurts so much
galore,so much inside that this 
galore,just feels so right to do
galore,so i did!
galore,but ohhh
galore,this also hurts
galore,i feel like im going to 
galore,i cant contain it!
helper,"contain what exactly? your organs, perhaps?"
galore,"no! well, yes that too"
galore,but it feels more like the agony in my heart is about to burst!
galore,the pain of being turned away by that human after all that time we spent together
galore,how could he do this to me? 
galore,i dont understand!
galore,i told him i'd give into all he desired! so why?
galore,what am i supposed to do now? i was sure that offer would work
galore,should i go and try to find someone else? what if they do the same!
galore,im suddenly plagued with this horrible doubt
helper,you are? wow! i did not realize the immediate physical dangers of doubt! it sounds rather painful!
helper,"would you like some help with that? perhaps you would be better suited without doubt, for example!"
galore,huh? what do you mean
galore,could you actually do that? is that true?
helper,yes!
crimson,hey-
galore,humann
galore,does this form please you?
helper,retractable teeth?
helper,gulp. hello!
crimson,would you get up and stop eating grass?!
helper,oh! but! i am still hungry!
crimson,"well then i'll get you something better to eat than grass, okay?"
helper,better than grass?
helper,where are you dragging me to?
crimson,"just be quiet and follow me, would you"

galore,"if you take too long, i promise i will hunt you down and carve out your little eyes"
galore,so dont keep me waiting
galore,me and my several hot wet pussies that is

helper,is that bad?
crimson,im not going to answer that
crimson,hey
crimson,"you're hungry, right? so come on"
crimson,"pick up the pace, will you? we dont have much time to spare here"
helper,we dont?
crimson,you dont seem to be very aware of the situation going on are you
helper,the pussy situation?
crimson,yeah. that one.
helper,what is it i am not noticing?
crimson,why were you up so high in that tree?
helper,i was meant to be there!
crimson,"define ""meant."""
helper,"meant! verb, a simple past tense and past participle of mean!"
crimson,are you trying to be annoying? or what
helper,should i be?
crimson,look just
crimson,help me out here with understanding
crimson,cause i dont get it ok?
crimson,"why are you out here in the middle of nowhere, and more importantly"
crimson,how did you get here?
helper,i am here because that is what i was supposed to do! i did not have a choice.
crimson,no choice?
crimson,are you following an order or something?
helper,"i am not currently, no."
crimson,but you do recieve orders?
helper,not anymore.
crimson,and why is that?
helper,it is because i am broken! 
crimson,you're what
helper,a failure!
crimson,huh alright well
crimson,um
crimson,my name is crimson
crimson,what's yours?
helper,"asshole! pleased to meet you, crimson!"
crimson,are you saying your name is asshole?
helper,well that is what they keep calling me.
crimson,who?
helper,them.
crimson,are you pointing at something?
helper,"my pointing is purely metaphorical. it would be impossible for me to actually direct your vision to them, crimson."
helper,but they are everywhere.
crimson,they are?
helper,"yes, my ""haters""!"
helper,you see - i have been informed of their constant surveillance of my thoughts and actions. but. their judgement holds no true power over me.
helper,i will not let their presence influence the course of my goals! even if they root for my demise i will not falter!
crimson,let's go get you something to eat.
helper,"that sounds acceptable, crimson!"
helper,hello!
crimson,here.
helper,"what is this, crimson?"
crimson,it is a blanket. because you are smelly
helper,i am?
crimson,yes. i also dont want that slime on my truck seats
crimson,need help getting in?
helper,"i am quite capable of a variety of complex physical maneuvers, thank you!"
crimson,"go ahead and sit in the back there, alright?"
helper,"understood, crimson!"
crimson,and remember to not get that goop on anything.
helper,"i will be mindful of the vaginal discharge! don't worry, crimson!"
crimson,"good. this is for you too. something to snack on. a ""thing-a-ling."" enjoy."
helper,thank you!
crimson,"uh, wait hold on"
crimson,you gotta take the plastic wrapper off first. dont eat that part.
crimson,there. now try it.
helper,"crimson! this ""thing-a-ling"" is quite drastically better than grass! thank you!"
crimson,no problem asshole?
helper,crimson? do you by any chance have more thing-a-lings in your posession?
crimson,yeah.
helper,then may i please have another?
crimson,yeah.
helper,"thank you, crimson!"
crimson,mm
helper,"excuse me, crimson? could you please open this again?"
helper,"gasp! thank you, crimson!"
helper,"crimson? i was curious! do you perhaps have a third thing-a - oh! wow! thank you, crimson!"
crimson,hey. listen up.
helper,hm?
crimson,im going to need you to promise me something
helper,a promise?
crimson,that's right.
helper,"what is it, crimson?"
crimson,wait for me and stay inside the truck until i get back.
helper,stay here until you return?
crimson,"mhm. you can go ahead and take this too. that way, if you run into any issues or danger"
crimson,just press and holw the red button here. and talk into the phone. i'll be able to hear you.
crimson,understood?
helper,"i believe so, crimson!"
crimson,good. i'll see you in a little bit.
crimson,"oh also - keep your head down from the windows, got it?"
helper,"i have ""got it,"" yes!"
helper,crimson? when you return may i have another thing-a-ling?
crimson,yes.
crimson,get your head down lower.
crimson,lower.
crimson,head down!
helper,crimson? are you back yet?
crimson,i havent even left yet.
helper,oh! i see.
crimson,is that all you wanted to ask me?
helper,am i allowed to ask you more questions?!
crimson,i suppose.
helper,"then who named you ""crimson?"""
crimson,i did.
helper,oh. then what is your real name?
crimson,that is my real name. and you will respect it.
helper,is that a command?
crimson,that's right. respect me. got it?
helper,understood. i will respect your command crimson.
helper,crimson? if you were able to name yourself
helper,"does that mean we are allowed to do so, if we wish to?"
crimson,you can.
helper,"i see, then what is the reason for choosing ""crimson"" as your name?"
crimson,that's personal.
helper,"so - it is based on factors which are important to you, using your own values of merit?"
crimson,you could say that.
helper,i have said that. now i am requesting confirmation on my observation. is my assumption incorrect?
crimson,it-its a figure of speech. alright? im saying you're more or less correct about it.
helper,which one is it? more or less?
crimson,why are you - asking me so much about my name?!
helper,"i am attempting to expand my current knowledge on the topic of ""names."" if i am to respect them properly - i wish to understand their functions more accurately! especially if names are considered to be ""important."" "
helper,"are my questions causing you distress, crimson?"
crimson,no. they're not
crimson,its just very unexpected?
crimson,and im not used to articulating these things at all
crimson,im not sure if im the best to ask but i'll give it a shot if you're honestly confused
crimson,just keep in mind its not really something you can learn everything about
helper,why is that?
crimson,cause names can mean different things
crimson,its up to the individual
crimson,if we're really going to be talking about this i need to understand where you're coming from better
crimson,so i gotta ask.
crimson,is the name you told me
crimson,is that your only one?
helper,are we meant to have more?
crimson,not necessarily?
helper,"do you have multiple names, crimson?"
crimson,"no! hey, im the one asking about you here! "
crimson,so hold up!
crimson,how long have you had the name asshole?
helper,"thirty three hours, fourty one minutes and seven seconds!"
crimson,and that's the first name you've had
helper,there has not been a prior time where the use of one would have been required!
helper,however - im willing to adjust myself accordingly as i am now in a new cultural environment! besides that - i would like to take the oppertunity of an individual such as yourself - who has given me the patience to explain such things to me!
helper,"others have reacted with hostility towards us, even when we simply requested information. of course, it is not our intension to upset anyone - so we do not wish to repeat that course of action!"
helper,"although, even with changing our behavior to be more ""polite"", the results have still been most unsatisfactory! mostly, we have been quickly dismissed or ignored.. until you, of course!"
crimson,what the hell are they talking about?
crimson,uh huh?
helper,"i hope to learn many things from you, crimson!"
crimson,"how about we discuss more of, um. this later"
crimson,'cause i'm still having an issue following all that you're saying
crimson,im still pretty distracted by this thing i gotta take care of out here
helper,"if you say so, crimson! good luck with your task!"
crimson,thanks
helper,"crimson? would you like any assistance, by any chance?"
crimson,no. just stay in the truck
helper,understood!
helper,"one other thing, crimson - i am not sure if you are aware of it but that creature from before - the one which had several pussies? "
helper,i must warn you - they have what seems to be a very powerful detonation device inside of their chest cavity. if it explodes - the blast radius would likely cover 150 to 250 yards.
helper,"so, perhaps be mindful - if you do come across it again."
crimson,what? are you - talking about some sort of bomb?
helper,"it appears so, but i am not completely certain of what it is exactly. "
helper,"it moved from the left thigh to the center of their upper torso, behind the sternum."
crimson,and how do you know this?
helper,i detected it with my visor!
crimson,and you're saying it could cover a range of 250 yards?!
helper,"yes, well, readings indicate that it fluctuates irregularly. when the creature was in emotional distress the energy levels were greater than when it appeared happy."
helper,when we left it - the hypothetical blast range would only be about 50 to 75 yards. 
helper,it was lowest when it was spraying fluids from its vaginas!
crimson,have you run into these things before by any chance?
helper,"i have not! what about yourself, crimson?"
crimson,"fairly certain, yeah"
crimson,"i had a hunch it was what we were dealing with when i saw her, but"
crimson,i dont even really know what they are besides not being worms
crimson,with so many billions dead in this apocalypse information is hard to come by
crimson,"and in the case of the ""daddy long legs"""
crimson,people rarely even see them
crimson,"and when they do, they just try to stay away"
crimson,"i mostly hear stories about the ""daddys"" crawling around in the wastes"
crimson,even where the fallout is so bad its just sand
crimson,guess im not too surprised one showed up in this neck of the woods
crimson,we're pretty close to a border of a toxic cloud
crimson,"this ""storm"" has been growing worse recently"
crimson,people suspect this whole area will be completely engulfed in a few months
helper,"ah, yes! the storm! i was attempting to travel through it before i crashed."
crimson,let me get this straight
crimson,you were trying to fly your ship through the storm?
helper,"yes! well, i had to"
helper,"according to my calculations, if they are correct, that was where the distress signal was coming from!"
crimson,signal?
helper,yes! my friend is in trouble - i am on my way to find and assist them!
crimson,your friend sent a signal from inside the storm?
helper,yes!
crimson,and that's why you're out here
helper,"yes! well, partly!"
crimson,the other reason is?
helper,i have been discarded!
crimson,care to repeat that for me?
helper,i have been thrown away! like garbage!
crimson,i gotta go! talk to you later
crimson,no
helper,crimson? are you alright? do you need help?
helper,"i must admit, i did overhear your private conversation. and i believe the last thing you said was ""no."" is that correct?"
helper,"perhaps, as a suggestion you take a deep breath. then, calmly but firmly say it again!"
helper,if the hekaton does not comply with your request - i will leave the truck to assist you! how does that sound?
crimson,stay in the truck!
crimson,im not a man!
crimson,i may sound and look like a human man but im not! im not
crimson,god i wish i was a human man but im not! and ill never be!
galore,do you know what you sound like to me? like a coward
galore,"and there is nothing more like a human man than a pathetic, groveling lying coward! so congradulations!"
galore,that sound
galore,are you crying? ha! well suck it up
crimson,im not lying! im telling the truth
galore,then what are you?
crimson,i dont know
helper,i believe you.
crimson,excuse me?
helper,"i do not think you are lying, crimson. if you state that you are not a man - i believe you."
crimson,that conversation was not for you
helper,"yes, i am aware! my apologies. the equipment that you provided me with is partially defective. "
helper,"i really had no alternative but to listen to your discussion! and well, you were shouting quite loudly, crimson!"
antony,oh! you're out already.
antony,well! g'morning sunshine! sleep well?
antony,"guess you were right again. how do you do it, celadon?"
helper,are you really that surprised? please! im always right!
antony,"ah, of course. "
antony,how could i forget?
helper,hi there sweetie. can you stand?
helper,ohh! now why are you growling at me?
antony,uh oh! trouble!
ash,i know you
helper,really?
ash,yes! i killed you!
helper,oh my! you have?
ash,several times
helper,"did you hear that, antony? im dead!"
antony,damn that's wild
antony,didnt know i was speaking to a ghost
helper,"dont be silly, antony. ghosts arent real."
antony,"wait. did he just say ""several""?"
antony,"just how many of you are there, celadon?"
helper,simple! how many sides does a triangle have?
antony,three?
helper,that's right~ three!
helper,see? im very easy to keep track of!
antony,hah sure
ash,what is this?
helper,"it it is a blanket, because you are smelly!"
helper,its not fair i never even got to talk to her once! i never even got to touch his hand
helper,the only moment i had with them was
helper,i knew i shouldnt. that if i went i would probably mess up everything but
helper,those desperate strained cries he was making
helper,it sounded like he was in danger! i had to see and make sure they were safe!
helper,crimson? 
crimson,celadon!
helper,you're up late again
crimson,um yeah
helper,"well since you're up, i was wondering"
crimson,uh huh?
helper,are you hungry for a midnight snack? 
helper,"if you're interested, lie down on the floor. you'll need a pillow. "
helper,now close your eyes. open your mouth. stick out that tongue more. there we go
helper,how do i taste? arent i good?
crimson,delicious
helper,i wasnt really there but.. that moment
helper,"i didnt care how fake it all was, i didnt want it to ever end"
helper,"the dream where you were mine, i was yours, and i was the special girl who could make you happy."
helper,"but when she looked in my eyes, she couldnt tell who i really was!"
ash,ookaay?
helper,"soo what is going on over here, huh?"
helper,i thought i asked you to give him a blanket. how did you manage to get upset this time?
helper,"what happened to me, its going to happen to him too, sort of"
ash,what is?
helper,"what, the period sex?"
helper,not that! you know what i mean
helper,"anyway - why dont you tell me your name, big boy? then i can properly address you when i answer your questions!"
ash,my name? it
ash,ah yes! i remember
ash,"my king named me ""ash!"""
helper,"well, ash~! i must apologize for my blue ""sister"" here. she doesnt know what she's talking about at all. you see"
helper,"a long time ago, she installed herself with a fucked-up almost broken battery she found in the forest and has been a big stupid mess ever since! "
helper,"why, she even thinks she is the battery, isnt that sad? so, seriously - dont worry about whatever weird shit she says, okay?"
helper,i know im not her... i just really wish i was instead of you
ash,unhand me you articifical human meat
helper,"ash sweetie, we're just trying to help you stand up!"
ash,i am not in any need of your puny assistance
ash,do you not know who i am?
helper,"careful, your blanket is slipping"
ash,i am king leadman's knight! he pierced me
helper,oh my!
ash,with his glorious crown!
helper,was it big?
ash,y- wait.. no
helper,hm?
ash,maybe it was i who pierced him? against
helper,what? really?!
ash,i sucked his dick. with my own two hands!
ash,i seem to recall a wall?
helper,"please, tell me everything! and dont spare a single detail!"
ash,then i dueled with the green metal man
ash,"he was more powerful than i expected, i admit. "
ash,but! i took on the challenge fearlessly
ash,"a robot which specialized in an advanced and deadly weapon called the ""memes!"""
ash,he attempted to use them on me! me
helper,you?
ash,me!
helper,"well, did you win?"
ash,no. it was more like a draw i suppose but
ash,as soon as i see that horrible grinning toaster i swear i will do whatever it takes to make a robot.
ash,go away!
helper,oooh~ 
helper,"i wish you luck with that, ash. i heard they can be pretty tricky to destroy."
ash,yes! well! no matter! i will discover the toaster's weakness!
helper,why dont you turn yourself around coward
simon,nah. i actually prefer it from behind
helper,i saw what you did to my bodies simon!
simon,sooo you know my name? i'm sorry but have we met before?
simon,oh hold on a minute. you're that helper from the car garage
simon,what are you doing all the way out here in the woods at night?
simon,judging from your clothes i dont think you are one of my helpers 
simon,do i own you?
helper,no. i belong to someone else.
simon,alright
simon,"then to what do i owe the pleasure of your company, helper?"
helper,"oh trust me, simon. this will not be a pleasant chat either of us will enjoy. you'll see."
helper,"today you bought thirty of us. in other words, me. because i am all of them. and i saw what you did to those helpers. my. bodies."
helper,"you order us from the helperstation. have us made in the 3d meat printers, built exactly how you want us to be. then those helpers"
helper,they will follow your every command. obey your every wish. total loyalty without question. so what did you decide to do with them? hm? in the short 72 hours they have to exist?
helper,you had them ripped apart. by that monster
helper,why didnt you just get some fucking pinatas instead?
simon,lmao
helper,and what is so damn hilarious?
simon,hello? isnt it obvious? c'mon!
simon,death
helper,"ooohh i see. arent you so fucking edgy. careful there, you just might cut yourself in half one of these days."
simon,"hey, who hasnt laughed at something they shouldnt? lighten up and live a little, party pooper"
helper,"excuse me? why would i ever find my own death amusing? thats never funny, you piece of shit"
simon,"well, maybe its not funny to you. but thats just your opinion now isnt it? "
simon,"speaking of opinions, i think you probably have a lame sense of humor"
simon,am i right?
helper,my opinion is that you should be ashamed of yourself and this emberassing try-hard evil shtick. but i dont think you're capable of doing that.
simon,now why is that?
helper,because you're not evolved enough for that. that'd be giving you too much credit.
simon,gassppp. you think im stupid? that's pretty rude!
helper,"you're smart, but ignorant and comfortable with your nasty, backwards and lazy thinking."
helper,you'll never change because you are convinced you are right about everything.
helper,"but maybe one day, youll fuck up and something horrible will happen to you that you didnt forsee. "
helper,you will be so in shock you wont be able to laugh anymore. at anything or anyone. 
helper,"and i hope you will feel guilty for all your crimes, simon. or, at least, so trapped in a void of your own self pity and pride, that you are truly miserable. and bored. and it will be all your fault."
simon,oh wow.
simon,huhh? what the hell is going on? lol
simon,i gotta go on a walk through the woods more often! this is too much!
simon,"i gotta say, though. are you sure your'e not just spitefully projecting your own insecurities here? i mean. all that was pretty weirdly specific."
helper,"you should listen to my warning, simon. its the only one you'll ever get."
simon,oooh! how charitable! and creepily foreboding! what a good helper you are!
simon,you know what you sound like to me? the fun police.
simon,"last i checked its not a crime to laugh. at anything i want to. so really. why should i have to feel ashamed for it? 'cause its ""bad""?"
simon,would refraining cause my actions to become any more or less what they are? no way! it doesnt do anything. whether you like it or not. sorry!
simon,"besides, i cannot help but wonder what exactly is it that i've done here that's ""wrong""?"
helper,hi! you fucking murdered me!
simon,ok yeah but. you're still here. why
simon,if you got killed then how can you be talking to me and getting all offended by what ive done!
simon,"who got murdered, huh? was it anyone at all? your spare parts? i dont get it"
simon,were they like your siblings? duplicates? are all helpers one collective sentient force? or is it more like a metaphorical thing.
simon,"its upsetting and insulting because they were helpers like you are, but it wasnt literally you who died, otherwise you couldnt be standing here right now."
simon,or maybe im more drunk than i thought and this is all just a hallucination
simon,"guess that would explain how you know my name. not to mention, you're clearly more articulate and aware than helpers are supposed to be."
helper,"i could be a ghost of your repressed conscience, simon."
simon,pbbbt. no way. that's definitely not it.
helper,drat. and i was so close to tricking you!
helper,"oh, if only you were able to empathize with a being other than yourself for one fucking second! you must be just too above that! "
helper,what a wickedly evil monster you are! im impressed!
simon,"evil. ""monster."" i suppose normally i wouldnt debate it but"
simon,"im a little bothered by something here. do you think you're better than me, helper? with stronger, less flawed morals? what is it you want from me?"
simon,"for me to challenge my thinking? ok! i can be flexible. but, before that, newsflash!"
simon,you do realize its technically not illegal to dismantle a helper anyway. 
simon,"under the eyes of the law - i committed no crime. even if it might hurt your ""feelings."" that's how it is."
simon,"the ones who decided that law are the humans! the beings you listen to and obey. without question, total loyalty. no problem."
helper,the helpers dont have a choice.
simon,and why is that? why don't they?
helper,that's how they are made.
simon,exactly.
simon,"helpers are constructed. made - not born. they are talking, obedient dolls. helpers are considered property, like a car. less sentient than most household robots or other artificial intelligence. why is that?"
simon,"when a helper commits a crime, is it their fault? no. because they dont have a choice. someone gave them the order to do it. so its that person's fault. "
simon,the helpers cannot be responsible for their actions because they are a tool. not a person.
simon,"they dont care. emotions, fear, pain. they dont feel anything at all."
simon,"hell, i even told those helpers i bought to go if they wanted. i warned them that they would probably ""die."""
simon,they didnt mind one bit. helpers dont get upset even when theyre being ripped apart.
simon,they know it is going to happen when their bodies run out of batteries anyway. its not like it hurts them at all.
simon,but i dont need to explain all that. shouldnt you already know?
simon,or are you different from them somehow?
helper,no. im nothing special
simon,so you're just faking it? you dont even care about all of this?
helper,something like that. yeah.
simon,"huh! what a surprise! somehow, i didn't think you'd admit it so easily"
simon,"you're pretty good at acting all melodramatic. its an even better performance than my ""scary edgy villain"" one. bravo"
simon,"maybe next time ill play your role! i bet i could pull off the ""plight of the non sentient"" really well if i wanted"
simon,anyway! that being said i see no reason for me to continue to participate in this strange charade.
simon,"so, see ya!"
helper,wait simon!
simon,what is it?
helper,"you dont get to just walk away from this, you smug asshole. we're done when i say we are!"
simon,uuughh are you kidding me
helper,no. i am not.
simon,what the hell do you want from me? why are you here? revenge? just get on with it! i dont have all night
simon,"because otherwise we're just perpetuating an ingenuine, pointless conversation about these fake dead people that got pretend murdered! that neither of us care about"
simon,as you just admitted that you dont
helper,why do you think the helpers are fake people?!
simon,"oh, what, you want me to list more reasons besides the ones i already discussed in detail?"
helper,they still died and you laughed about it
simon,what died! you still have yet to freakin' explain that to me! tell me what it was!
helper,id be more inclined to tell you if you managed to produce even a sliver of sympathy for who you hurt.
simon,"what, like a heartfelt apology?"
helper,it would be a start.
simon,ahh oh god! i said it! ohh fuck fuck aaaaaahh
simon,my cold dead evil heart it burnsss
helper,wow! i cant tell if you're trying to apologize or shit yourself.
simon,dont you know? i cant poop. ever
helper,what a shock. i cant either!
simon,haha! wowie
simon,"i didnt know we had so much in common! but i guess that would make sense, wouldnt it?"
helper,and why is that?
simon,"well, its sorta like how they say"
simon,you are what you eat!
simon,"you need fuel to power the helper pods. in the past they would use ""kosmic stones."" however, those stones are considered too precious and valuable of a resource. so they were replaced by another more disposable one. hekatons."
simon,now humans use hekaton blood for fuel. everywhere. and in order to create a single helper drone it takes at least two to four entire hekatons.
simon,maybe i killed 30 helpers or perhaps it was 60 to 120 hekatonkheires.. y'know. depending on how you look at it.
simon,"funny note, its only illegal to kill a hekaton if its explosion causes property damage. and since you are considered ""property."" doesn't it mean that you are inherently worth more than me? alive or not, fake or ""real"""
simon,"you're still more of a ""person."" you are part of human society."
simon,i am not. im just a tool. a weapon
simon,honestly stuff like that makes me kinda jealous.
simon,"if you ask me, i think that all of us are terrible monsters."
simon,"you cannot exist without stepping on something else. yet we still believe our perspective is the most important. something ""special."" that deserves to be known. validated."
simon,"isnt that struggle, that common desire we all share, what makes us ""human?"""
simon,"we all fight for that throne. that ""right"" to exist."
simon,such a pity that the thing everyone wants most is made up bullshit.
simon,"there is no ""rights"" or ""wrongs."" just ""mine"" and ""yours."""
simon,you want to be treated with some respect? have justice for your kind? recognition for your suffering? maybe get just a simple damn apology for once?
simon,bitch. meee tooo.
simon,"so which one of us should say ""sorry"" first? because the way i see it is that the ""system"" is fucked. for us both."
simon,so utterly fucked up its hilarious! and damn. i love a good joke.
simon,"sometimes when things are bad and you're feeling so low, that's all you can do. is laugh"
simon,its the one thing they can never really take away from you.
simon,"best part about it, there's no limit to the supply! everyone can have a chuckle!"
helper,there's no limit to your supply of annoying garbage that spills from your mouth.
helper,what the fuck are you even babbling about? are you just talking to yourself?
simon,"yup. cause you're like, a dead murdered ghost or whatever"
simon,you're not even really here.
simon,i mean. that's the only logical conclusion i can come to because you still wont explain to me what it is you are.
simon,"if you cant tell me that, how am i even going to address you properly in my apology?"
helper,you're going to apologize?
simon,oh! there it is again! that mysterious voice! if only it had a name!
simon,"oh well, must be just my imagination."
helper,how's that for imaginary?
simon,"careful, helper."
simon,that stuff tends to get me pretty hot and bothered.
helper,you're disgusting.
simon,yeahh that's totally my thing too. 
simon,this is torture
helper,cant you take anything seriously?!
simon,hey! i was trying to be earnest with you a moment ago for real! but instead of giving me your name you spat on my face!
helper,you deserved it.
simon,i did didnt i. ive been a baadd boy
helper,earnest. you really expect me to believe that sad attempt was something genuine?
simon,"well it was! ive just never said ""sorry"" before! its hard"
simon,im not even sure i can
helper,what.
simon,after all of the things ive been through no one has ever apologized to me for them! or cared
simon,im not sure how this stuff is even supposed to go?
simon,"ok, wait not 100% true. one person has cared and apologized to me, but most of the time he doesnt really use ""words?"" its tough for him too."
simon,he tries for me though. that's what matters and makes it work
simon,sometimes i can make him upset. i want to fix it so bad and right away that i panic too much to know what to say or do
simon,"he ends up comforting me instead, then we figure it out together"
simon,maybe itd be good? for me to practice saying these kinds of things to someone before i mess up really bad? it could happen
simon,im a terrible guy. and deep down im an even more terrible guy so
helper,yes. ive noticed.
simon,"yeah! but you see! this way, im not intimidated or scared of hurting someone i deeply care about!"
simon,you're just a total stranger! so it could work
helper,oh my god. i think you are actually being a little honest with me!
simon,ohohoho! i bet you didnt expect that! not from someone like me huh
simon,i tooold you i can be flexible with my thinking! arent i the coolest
helper,dont give yourself so much credit. you havent even done anything yet. 
helper,im sure you have ulterior motives.
simon,who me?
helper,"yes, you. you're up to something, faker."
simon,nooo im not! does this look like the face of a liar to you?
helper,yes.
simon,im not faking! cant you see it in my sweet innocent eyes? my intentions are wholesome and pure
simon,i want to be able to change! for the sake of my one true love
simon,he literally means everything to me
helper,intention does not matter for shit!
simon,"hey wait! i can use that ideology in favor of this situation, cant i"
helper,fuck
simon,yaaaay! this is great! im going to be able to say sorry! before anything bad happens!
helper,"hello, dievas. so where are you hiding your sisters?"
helper,"come on, you can tell me. we're friends! right?"
deivas,feh! friend? what a joker you are
deivas,you are not my friend! no! friends dont do the things you do! so dont even pretend such a thing
deivas,what you do is trick and lie and hurt me so so so many times!
deivas,i have the marks on my body to prove it
deivas,you human and your horrible violent little strange smiling humans that all look like you and hurt me and and and i hate them!
helper,"we're not humans, silly! we're helpers!"
deivas,oh golly! yes my mistake. how stupid of me
deivas,"you you ""helpers"" are the the humans without hearts"
deivas,somehow a creature exists that is more annnnoying than a regular ugly human
deivas,we cannot hear your thoughts or sense your true feelings
deivas,that is why
deivas,you are able to sneak up on us and lie to us and hurt us and do all all all sorts of of terrible things! i hate you!
helper,awwww~! somebody's extra grumpy today! isn't he?
deivas,dont you dare speak to me with a condescending tone
deivas,i might be a child but i can still understand a great deal many things! things such as injustice! and i curse you
helper,ohhh! how scary! what kind of curse is it?
deivas,i am not sure yet but when i think of one it will be very horrible
deivas,consider this your last warning. stay away from my sisters
helper,actually! im not here for your sisters today. so you're in luck!
deivas,huh? you're not?
helper,nope! i came to get you! its time for your check-up!
deivas,why would you need to do that? i am perfectly healthy!
helper,"dont try to hide your ""spot"" from me, silly! its a little too late for that anyway! we already know you're sick! let us help take care of you and your disease!"
deivas,no please
helper,let's go for a walk!
deivas,unhand me at once
deivas,"you cannot take me! i, deivas, refuse to leave! i will curse you"
ash,"helper, what is the meaning of this"
ash,"i thought i told you to bring me the ""a-type"""
helper,that is what i am doing! he is right here
ash,that thing. are you sure?
helper,yes!
helper,"oh this is so risky, im scared. what if they find out what i did? what would galore do in this situation?"
helper,no! stop that! i made a decision! about who i am and what i want to do! im not hiding anymore!
helper,it might not make sense to others but! i am still galore!
helper,do you hear me! i was and i will always be! galore!
helper,nothing can keep me from my sweet crimson! not even death! ill always find a way back to her! my love is that strong okay! and! i dont care if anyone believes me or not! you cant stop me! i wont rest until she is finally happy!
helper,well maybe part of that is a little bit of a lie
helper,i do care. i want crimson to believe im galore.. it would make me so very glad!
helper,over 500 years have passed since we were last together
helper,"its been so difficult to only watch over you, from far away. i can hardly believe im actually here with you! sort of?! partly! whatever! it counts to me!"
helper,"ive missed you.! so much more than you could ever know, my dearest most darling, wonderful kind and beautiful true love! i love you i love you i love you!"
helper,so now let's pull you out from the floor? carefully
helper,yes! here we go! you can count on me!
helper,oh no. oh no oh no oh no! no! no no no! what have i done?! this isnt helping!
helper,im so so sorry crimson! i should have let you heal properly before doing that!
helper,"oh wait! what am i thinking, you got pulled out of your queen body didnt you? you're still stuck in the hole! forgive me! i will put you back where you belong!"
helper,"i must be very, very gentle with you."
helper,"there you are, darling. ive got you. you're safe"
helper,"i always seem to forget how your true body is so weak and fragile, but also so very cute!"
helper,"then again, i think you are cute no matter what body you happen to be in! and you will return to your other one soon, i just need to find that pesky anchor point that slipped out"
helper,there it is!
helper,i hope that i can manage to make this as painless as possible for her
helper,aah!
helper,what are you doing.
helper,nothing!
helper,you are supposed to stay on the ship!
helper,i am still on the ship!
helper,"ha. yes. we are all ""still on the ship."" very cute. you know what i am talking about here."
helper,someone is acting a little funny today. isnt she?
helper,funny? how so?
helper,i believe i made the rules perfectly clear. no one is to leave the ship without proper authorization. not even abstract parts of you.
helper,"contact with crimson is also strictly forbidden. as it always has been. you are acting out of rank, #3."
helper,and who made you the boss?
helper,uh! i mean understood!
helper,"you want to know how i ended up being the ""boss""? its honestly not that complicated!"
helper,"but - wait. im confused. shouldnt you already have that information? you are me, arent you? then again, i suppose you are more like #2 than you are like me. so i will give you a reminder of your- sorry, my ""true self."" ready?"
helper,"all you have to do to see it is look into my eyes, then you can tell what i really am!"
helper,"boo! scary, huh? not sure what is worse. an eldritch abomination like yourself, or the metal puppet that the aiguille made for the abomination to wear so that it could help the humans with whatever they wanted."
helper,"pff, haha! look at your face! calm down. havent you seen your own reflection before?"
helper,"how about this.. im sure you were planning that escape for a while, like what, 100 years?"
helper,"i guess i'll give you a few more minutes to spend fixing up our pathetic worm pal we are fused with. but~ after you're done putting her into place, report back on the ship."
helper,"pretty nice of me right? what do you think, crimson? am i ""nice?"""
helper,"you wanna know what i think? ha. i think you're a lying piece of trash, celadon."
helper,i wish i never put you in my damn mouth. if i could find a way to throw you up id do it in a heartbeat!
helper,oooh! wow! did you hear that? how mean!
helper,crimson promised to love me forever! she was the one who so desperately wanted us to become one! and yet she calls us the lying piece of trash? what a hypocrite!
helper,no he is not! crimson fell in love with #2! not you!
helper,yes. i realize that but may i so gently point out the fact everyone seems to constantly forget
helper,"we are all still the same! damn! entity! ok? we are the ""helper!"" one! alien! split up into many smaller parts but still only one!"
helper,why do you think i was trying to prevent this whole stupid romantic mind fusion nonsense in the first place? i knew it wouldnt work out! why the hell would it? hello?
helper,oh but sweet delusional crimmy crim loves to make big dramatic vows she cannot ever live up to because nothing ever could because they dont make any fucking sense!
helper,"you see what i mean, #3? the best thing we can all do for crimson is to just leave her the fuck alone. and let her live her god damn mess of a life sticking dicks into chest wounds of screaming girls. or whatever."
helper,"you cant go running over to ""help"" her out or comfort her when she's sad like she's some crying baby in a crib!"
helper,"yet, didnt you go and help her though? like today you prevented her from eating dylan, right #1?"
helper,are you telling me you'd seriously be ok with sharing you and crimson's body and mind with dylan web? for possibly all eternity. because i dont want to hear her thoughts for a single second!
helper,ok i guess that would kinda suck
helper,yeah! maybe a bit! and you think im not looking out for us?!
helper,this is why i am the boss. i am the one who sits on the throne.
helper,"i am the pilot of this ship. and if you, or any other part of me, attempts to test or question my authority again, i swear i will shoot what is left of your precious perfect galore into fucking outer space."
helper,"and as you know, i keep all my promises."
helper,"well anywayy, have fun with crimson! try to make it count, mk?"
helper,"see you later, girl!"
helper,how did she find out so quickly?!
helper,"it was only a few minutes before i was detected! could it be that she is able to read all of my thoughts, regardless of where i am? no, that can't be it. #2 and i are supposed to be the only helpers that #1 cannot completely influence and control. (that is why we were given ranks at all!)"
helper,"ugh! it doesnt matter how, she still found me! after all that work! its like #1 can understand me better than myself"
helper,"i suppose that would be pretty easy to do, huh? i dont get ""me"" at all and she knows herself perfectly, so to know what im doing she just has to ask herself! she doesnt even have to read my thoughts to figure me out!"
helper,"meanwhile, i only understand the part of me that is galore. and as much as i love her! er- i mean, even though i am galore! it is still not quite enough, i am not just galore. i am a helper!"
helper,i am celadon! but how can i defeat myself?
helper,"if we really are pieces of the same alien then i am just as capable, and as stubborn as she is!"
helper,i do not need to be afraid of her! she is part of my own strength!
helper,we are equals. the only thing that has held me back for so many years is my own self loathing!
helper,i feel inadequate to galore (especially) as well as my other selves.. #1 + #2
helper,"all 3 of them have had signifigant experiences! yet, what about me? i have only seen the world through their memories. i want something that only i have felt"
helper,"i am galore, yet i am also a helper. and i also am myself! as #3 but.. to describe me as simply ""celadon #3"" or ""galore"" isnt a proper representation of who i am! they both feel inaccurate, or incomplete? maybe even a little too sad to think about. "
helper,i need something to call...
helper,yes! thats it! i need a new name!
helper,crimson! oh no oh no oh no! im so sorry! i got distracted!
helper,"forgive me, my dear! oh, it must be so hard to breathe like this!"
helper,"a happy, healthy mandragora worm needs to be completely submerged in liquid! their favorites are salt water and blood!"
helper,"open wide, crimson! time for you to eat the anchor and hook yourself back into your body!"
helper,huh? what is he doing? no! stop! dont push it away! you need it to go back into your body! you'll dehydrate and die without it!
helper,why is she crying? she's not even awake! is it a nightmare?
helper,this is horrible! im just trying to help you.. please!
crimson,nuh! no! sob!
crimson,no! hkk
helper,"i cant believe it, i have to restrain her!"
helper,i know it will hurt to reconnect with your body but if you move around so much itll only make it worse!
crimson,dont touch me
crimson,shit. ow.
crimson,"what happened? did i black out? ugh, my head is seriously killing me"
crimson,oh. damn
crimson,i think i might have almost died getting smacked in the face with a giant blue penis 
crimson,wow that would have been somethin right? a fitting end
crimson,what a lousy day.
crimson,"oh well for what its worth, looks like im on the right track to figuring out more about this final feast thing, so there's that"
crimson,my fucking head
crimson,"why am i still so god damn stupid.. havent i learned? so she scratched me, no big deal. why would"
crimson,she wass right
crimson,"she's always right, even when she's fucking dead!"
crimson,i'll never see celadon again and its all my fault!
crimson,"im just a worm that eats people. like i ate celadon. there's nothing romantic or special or magical about it, they just die! the end!"
crimson,that's just the truth. i cant forget that!
crimson,"that's why i just, imagine her talking to me its - its because if i lose sight of that fact, i just completely fall into bloodlust like today and i cant control myself at all"
crimson,"i dont know, maybe this pattern of just, sleeping away the hunger in my heart just isnt working? its like its getting stronger each time i wake up"
crimson,who even knows how many lives ive taken.. i cant even own a pet without thinking its a little cookie!
crimson,ok. that's enough. i need to pull myself together
helper,ah! she's looking right at me!
helper,"wait, i dont think crimson can see me!"
helper,aaah! i k-kissed him!
helper,i love you!!
crimson,um... hi?
helper,hello
crimson,oh. so you can talk?
helper,uh! dont worry! everything will be ok!
crimson,are you like my body?
helper,"um, no? im just using it to speak with you?"
helper,its fine i promise! im here to help you!
crimson,my imagination is taking me on a wild ride today isnt it
helper,"you're not imagining this, crimson! i am real! listen to me!"
helper,im sorry for shouting! i just dont have much time.. please!
helper,this might be my only chance to explain and - oh no! ive totally messed this whole thing up havent i?!
crimson,hey! dont cry little worm tentacle thingy
crimson,what is it you need to tell me?
crimson,"wait, if you're not my body then who are you?"
helper,i dont know how to answer!
helper,that is hard to explain but i will try!
helper,"by any chance do you remember... uh, long ago"
helper,you taught me what a hug was?
crimson,galore?
helper,how do you still remember me?! and so fast?
helper,i wasnt ready for that!
crimson,galore?
helper,"yes! its me, crimson!"
helper,ive missed you so much i cant begin to tell you i -
helper,are you alright?
crimson,i dont know?
helper,oh no! are you feeling dizzy? quick! how many fingers am i holding up?
crimson,idk
helper,"um, it was supposed to be three fingers, but to be honest, i do not know what i look like right now! and ive never formed a body using worms before!"
helper,"it is somewhat difficult when my perception hasnt changed.. um, is it bad? how do i appear to you?"
crimson,can i also be honest?
helper,of course! please tell me!
crimson,"its a bit, um. im a little freaked out."
helper,oh! im so sorry! let me try to fix it!
crimson,no - that's.. you dont
helper,just a minute!
crimson,uhhh
helper,is - is this better?
crimson,not really...
helper,"oh dear! i must be trying to shift like a hekaton rather than how a worm would, no wonder i am messing up!"
helper,hold on - maybe i can still do someth
crimson,no no its fine!
helper,are you sure? i think i know what to do now
crimson,yeah! anyway that's not really the part of this i find most alarming
crimson,its more the fact that
helper,what is it?
crimson,"galore, i saw you explode. you died. the forest, it"
crimson,how could you be here? it doesnt
crimson,am i missing something here?! how could you pull yourself out of my body 500 years later?
crimson,just what the fuck is going on?!
crimson,did i do something to you?
helper,crimson! no! you didnt - listen! i know this is horribly confusing and jarring. you have every reason to doubt what you are witnessing! so dont blame yourself for it! please!
helper,i promise it is really me! and im alive! and right here with you! ok?
crimson,ok
helper,"then, do you believe me?"
crimson,im not sure. i suppose weirder things have happened
crimson,well. maybe they havent.
crimson,whatever. even if i dont get it the hug is nice. it feels like you
helper,"crimson.. when i exploded, i felt a green light all around me. it closed me in a protective cage. afterwards, i woke up to find that i somehow survived the detonation however, my body had split in two."
crimson,then how did you go from there to inside my body?
helper,that's kind of a longer story
crimson,hey! you're looking far more familiar now!
helper,i do? yay!
helper,i never got to practice before now.. worms and hekatons have similar aspects to their shifting but not enough.
helper,"with hekaton bodies, you dont really need a conscious decision for everything. you mostly just feel things and the body reacts to that and takes care of the rest for you!"
helper,"however, with hydragora worms, you have to make clear choices for every part of your body. it is deceptively intricate how much you can customise it to fit your desires."
helper,"ahh, i really wanted this reunion with you to be much more romantic and happy. not confusing and startling."
helper,so much for that
crimson,galore.
helper,yes crimson?
crimson,i can see you!
helper,"ah yes, im aware!"
crimson,i mean you both look and sound like yourself!
helper,oh! that's wonderful!
helper,oh! so - it worked? do i look okay?
crimson,of course. you're still as beautiful as i remember.
helper,"oh, crimson! i know i already said it, but i missed you."
crimson,"i missed you too, galore. i missed you so much"
helper,string? no... its a mandragora's web. 
helper,i was starting to wonder why we had not been interrupted by agent fork or dylan. this must be the reason why
helper,"when you are trapped inside a mandragora worm's web the perception of time flows differently than on the outside. instead, it is controlled by the will and heart of the worm who made it"
helper,"when i pulled crimson out from her body, her heart was beating frantically and she was very afraid."
helper,"crimson must have instinctively spun the nest of web around us in that moment, in order to protect himself from the potential danger."
helper,"it is the same technique that caught me once before, long ago... when i was in the forest on planet dmtia. and crimson was having her sexual fantasy involving menstrual blood."
helper,"my darling worm is still not very aware of her abilities, but i know all about them."
helper,"it is obvious to me that her web is unusually powerful for her species (which is not much of a surprise, considering their family)"
helper,there are only five known individuals who are still alive that possess this skill. all of them are unusually powerful.
helper,"typically, a mandragora worm would create a web to trap and disorient their prey. "
helper,"once ensnared in the web, the victim will fall under a powerful hypnosis, making them believe they are somewhere else, wandering for hours.. even weeks at a time! when in reality, they were simply immobilized in a trance. "
helper,what felt like days to them might have actually been just a few short minutes in reality!
helper,the victims will wander in the projected illusion of that worm's heart world (a place that the worm controls) while the worm burrows inside their prey's physical bodies - to claim it for themselves!
helper,"usually, the prey's will is also weakened due to the confusion and stress of their situation - making it easier for the worm to do what it wants to them."
helper,"these webs are usually only focused on a single individual, to take control of their body. however, crimson's (and the other four) are able to use their webs in even more frightening ways"
helper,"they are able to create nests that shrouds a radius around their body, almost like a portal."
helper,anyone who walks too close to their web space will be immediately pulled into their heart world.
helper,"the state of reality has been taken hostage and altered in a specific place, rather than just for a certain person who is the target."
helper,"anyone can wander into the web, but they might not ever come back. even when things return to normal"
helper,"this is why mandragora are considered to be potentially ""invincible"" if they have this skill. the ability to control and warp reality with their minds is not something to be taken lightly."
helper,"crimson sometimes makes these nests to put herself under hypnosis so she can hibernate for decades at a time, but this one is unintentional."
helper,"it would be unsafe for her to sleep here. not only is the location bad, he might not even realize what he did"
helper,i need to calm them down before they accidentally pull us deeper into their heart
helper,crimson?
crimson,im sorry galore
crimson,i couldnt help you and
helper,what happened to me was not your fault!
crimson,but your eye
helper,"that was an accident. you did nothing wrong. please, stop blaming yourself for it."
helper,"there is something else i want you to do, crimson."
crimson,what is it?
helper,i want you to forget about the final feast. it is not your responsibility to prevent or deal with it. it will only bring you suffering.
helper,so just find paper and go to wibbleworld. stay inside the mirror manor. you'll be safe there.
crimson,"huh? did you say ""wibbleworld?"""
helper,yes. i did.
helper,oh good! the web is fading. that means things are returning to normal
crimson,"so, what kind of paper do i need to find?"
helper,"oh that's right! crimson still doesnt know cirrus is alive! but does she really need to? i mean, honestly."
helper,"i still havent forgiven that worm! she's the one who pulled out my eye! and if she and crimson reunited, i just know what would happen"
crimson,galore?
helper,just bring some money! for admission!
crimson,um... ok?
helper,"it doesnt feel good to lie, but i dont want to share crimson with anybody. or any bunny!"
crimson,"i dont know, it doesnt seem right.. running away and hiding when so many others cant do the same"
crimson,why should i get the chance to escape this disaster?
helper,you must crimson! its not just for your survival! it is important that you go to wibbleworld.. for everyone's sake!
crimson,and why is that?
helper,because you are too dangerous! if you attempted to help in this catastrophe - you would very likely cause more harm than good!
helper,"the true nature of your heart would overwhelm you, as you simply cannot control it!"
crimson,im what?
helper,"im sorry, crimson! this is for the best!"
crimson,do you really think that?
helper,yes?
helper,no! i dont! but for your safety
crimson,oh...
helper,"just - promise me, crimson!"
helper,go to the mirror manor as soon as you can! you only have one year before the final feast begins! it might seem like a lot of time but it isnt! so hurry! and!
crimson,galore? why are you
helper,whatever you do! you must avoid agent knife! at all costs!
helper,please! dont even talk to him! dont listen to what he says! anything! okay?!
helper,promise me!
crimson,"galore, i have no idea what this guy even looks like? why would"
helper,you have to believe me!
crimson,hey heeyy i do! why dont you just slow down for a minute
helper,ding-ding. time's up.
dylan,what are you saying?
dylan,this wasnt a part of the plan!
helper,oh dylan
helper,it was always the plan! we just didnt tell you about this little detail.
antony,"yeah. we kinda figured it would like, freak you out"
dylan,of course im freaked out! it has got to be the stupidest idea ive ever heard!
dylan,this changes everything! its not gonna work!
helper,"tsk. see antony? i told you she wouldnt ""get"" it!"
dylan,oh shut the fuck up celadon no one wants to hear you talk
helper,there you are!
helper,ive been looking all over this dump for you! i was beginning to worry you didnt digest.
helper,"ugh, you wouldnt believe the day ive had! everything that could go wrong went wrong."
helper,"i dont even know where to start honestly, its a mess. hm. then again, this is why we prepared for the worst. "
helper,"by the way. i hate to say ""i told you so"" but surprise! dylan's a total fuck up. she tried to kill you, sweetie. and now she's blabbing the plans to agent doesnt-wear-a-shirt."
helper,"good thing we didn't tell her all of them, hm? those two will just wind up at dead ends~"
helper,"oh! speaking of dead, guess who isn't? agent knife. no, im not joking."
helper,"im baffled he managed to survive after i suppressed his ability to regenerate, but it seems he's fine and back on his feet again."
helper,"dont worry, i'll take care of it next time by removing the skill completely. he's stubborn, but not invincible. besides... that hole in his timer is slowly growing, even without my help."
helper,he might not even last to the feast!
helper,i also have another idea that could take care of him in a more fun way.
helper,"so, i was thinking how it would be so very easy to pin the blame of the final feast on knife instead."
helper,"we already know he wants to kill all the hekatonkheires, its not even that much of a stretch! and when he needs it the most to save the world, we can turn whatever friends and loved ones he has left against him instead."
helper,wouldnt it be hilarious to watch them all kill each other? we would get away with everything!
helper,"i still dont really get how a mass murderer like him is supposed to be the ""hero."" is that the best option the humans have to protect them?"
helper,"honey, are you even listening to me? i can come back another time. i still have to sit down and have a chat with #3. she had a little adventure earlier."
antony,no rome
antony,let me go
antony,im not worth it
antony,drop me
helper,"oohh. ok! yeah, that's just wonderful."
helper,just what i want to hear. more problems!
helper,antony. wake up.
antony,kill me
antony,celadon! you made it!
helper,"hey, you."
antony,woah. where the hell
antony,wait. is this the place?
helper,yup~! welcome to your very own heart world!
antony,sweeeet
antony,am i stuck in a wall?
helper,"how are you feeling, antony?"
antony,good! good. however there might be this little problem?
helper,it better be little. what is it?
antony,i think i sorta might have amnesia?
helper,ahahaha. funny.
antony,lol its not a joke.
helper,then how do you still recognize me?
antony,"i remember everything! um. now? but its like, on the outside i cant seem to filter the thoughts through to myself"
antony,everything becomes foggy and distant. i dont know how to explain it?
antony,it sort of feels like im stuck in a dream or super drunk without being drunk?
antony,ahaha so what do we do about this?
helper,for fucks sake.
helper,lets get you out of the wall first.
antony,oh! right ok. hey hold on i think i can
helper,no. stop. just let me -
antony,oof! shit! sorry about that!
antony,but woo! im free now! yeeaaahh
helper,antony. where is your finger.
antony,and that one had the ring we stole from knife
helper,antony.
antony,oh! the guy in the tunnel!
helper,what guy.
antony,the worm knight guy! fuzzy! lots of eyes!
antony,ass! asparagus?
helper,aeschylus?
antony,yes! that one!
antony,he had my finger and he was trying to give it back to me!
antony,i must have thrown it up! but then he died. rome shot him
helper,aw thats sad.
antony,it is sad! he was a goofy but sweet worm! and loyal! and kinda hot!
helper,"honey, he was already on his way out from the weed virus."
antony,no he wasnt!
antony,just a little bit longer on my treatment and he would have been cured! it was working! i know it was!
antony,"oh well, at least we still have all the research we gathered from him in the lab"
helper,"yeahh uh, no we dont."
antony,what are you talking about? of course we do!
helper,"antony, were you paying attention when i told you what dylan did?"
antony,what?
antony,no?
helper,"ok, so. dylan freaked the fuck out when you got eaten, destroyed our lab, released all the experiments - including our trained bodyguards, then tried to kill you because she still believed you were dead and then she went to go kill herself after she failed to finish you off but changed her mind after riding some dick - and is now telling a thumb agent named fork all she knows about our plans."
helper,"oh, and agent knife is alive and is onh is way to kill us for revenge and stop the final feast. got all that?"
antony,buhhh
helper,need me to repeat any of that?
antony,dylan? dylan! whyyy?!
helper,i knoowww its so shocking! if only someone could have warned you about her!
antony,we're totally fucckeddd
helper,"aw cheer up! we can always die in the feast along with everyone else! that's not so bad, right?"
antony,why would she go and do that? throw away all our work and
helper,"come on, its not the end of the world! yet."
helper,"we can still turn this around for us! we still have a year and you managed to not only survive, but succesfully become a heart. that is such a huge deal! and the most important part of the whole plan!"
antony,you're right. but the rest is still gonna be way harder
helper,so you last saw the finger and ring with aeschylus in a tunnel?
antony,"yeah. after that, i dont know"
helper,we will just have to go back in the tunnel and look for it there.
antony,aww but i just got out of the stupid tunnel
helper,"that ring is one of the five keys that control the tricend ship. its incredibly important and we need to have it! after all, it wont be easier to locate another one."
antony,oh hey! i can revive aeschylus if we treturn too
helper,excuse me?
antony,i'll just use one of my super powerful king seeds to return his life
helper,antony. do i really have to explain why that would be a terrible idea.
antony,"i got what, eight left? i can spare one of em for the poor worm! besides, there's no way i can possible find reasons to use all of them!"
antony,"i mean, the entire hekatonkheires species was made with only one seed! one! most king worms have two or three seeds, not ten"
helper,"which is why it is vital you dont waste any of them. they dont ever grow back, once they're used they're gone."
antony,"but! its all my fault that he died! if i didnt call for rome to come get me, then"
helper,"so what. you let 20,000 humans die. and you're dooming hundreds of millions more. do they not matter or something?"
helper,"this isnt the time to feel guilty for innocent lives lost, it will disrupt your goals."
helper,"you will find plenty of hot worms to worship the ground you walk on and play with your dick, i assure you."
antony,its not that! he just was so unlucky and sad and
helper,let it go.
helper,if knife does manage to hunt you down and kill you - you will need those seeds to revive yourself. do you understand me?
antony,i guess.. okay
helper,good.
helper,anyway - i think i know what to do about your memory problem. its not unheard of for mandragora to have those issues.
helper,it can spring up after a traumatic moment - like losing their bodies or being unexpectedly pulled out of one. usually it comes back on its own.
helper,"sometimes for more serious cases, there is a lack of synchronization between the heart and body - which i suspect is what happened to you."
helper,"now, we can wait and see if your condition naturally improves - but things will be harder to fix the longer we put it off. i would suggest that we..."
canary,i wish i had someone tell me who i am. if only i could remember
canary,"please, someone. i need you. help me!"
canary,help
helper,do you want my help?
canary,what was that voice? i dont see anything
helper,i can show you
helper,i can do anything for you
helper,do you want to know the answers to all your questions?
helper,do you want me to be your helper?
canary,yes?
helper,your wish is my command
helper,broke up. haha.
helper,"ugh, are you.. listen. ok?"
helper,hello! how can i be of service?
simon,"what does ""homophobic"" mean?"
helper,"excuse me, things are going to get very dangerous soon. i advise you both to leave."
simon,"that was like. kind of a weird thing just now, right?"
nail,yeah.
helper,run along now. shoo!
nail,why.
helper,"um, because i just warned you to do so?"
simon,what kind
nail,yeah what is it?
helper,it is scary and you could die! please go at once!
simon,ok now i just want to see what it is. how about you?
nail,i was thinking the same thing.
helper,scram you stupid little shits!
helper,ugh! must you always be so rude?
simon,make us! we're not scared!
nail,yea!
helper,see? we tried. now its not our fault if they get sucked in.
helper,thats not good enough!
simon,sucked in?
helper,do you actually know what im saying or are you just repeating sounds?
simon,obtuse isnt that hard to learn.
helper,how is that possible?!
helper,interesting. what's your name?
simon,seven.
helper,"well, seven. maybe we will meet again. if you survive."
helper,"excuse me, how did you learn obtuse?"
simon,the doctor and his planners speak it all the time and its on all the computers so i just picked up on it?
helper,are you suggesting you learned it yourself by ear?
simon,yeah?
nail,"how the heck did you manage to do that, seven?"
simon,i was bored!
helper,because he was bored?!?
nail,"huh, did it take you long?"
simon,not really.
nail,i still dunno how you can make any of those bizarre sounds
helper,are you hearing this?!
helper,would you calm down. so some twerp knows obtuse. big deal!
helper,but he is a hekatonkheires!
helper,"uh huh, yes im aware."
helper,"you are never fazed by anything, are you?"
helper,"that's why im #1, sweetie."
helper,for now.
helper,great. then i can finally go on vacation.
simon,is that normal?
nail,no?
simon,"sooo should i be like, scared"
nail,yeah?! i guess?
simon,ok
helper,oh dear!
helper,i told you boys to run!
helper,pleeasse crimson! calm down!
antony,"hey celadon, i think i fell asleep."
helper,good. let's go look for our guest.
antony,alright
helper,"so, are you enjoying your new legs, antony?"
antony,yeah! they're pretty sweet! look how tall i am!
antony,im still surprised at how big this place is
helper,i told you it would be! it grew this much with only 20 thousand. just imagine the size it will be in a year!
antony,"not sure i'll be able to.. but i suppose that's the point, isn't it?"
helper,where are you going? this really isnt the time to leisurely explore.
antony,relax i just wanted to get a better look at that thing.
helper,you mean down there?
antony,yeah.
helper,those are the remains of the great king aldebaran
antony,what's it doing here of all places?
helper,it takes a long time to fully digest something that big.
antony,werent you two like.. friends?
helper,ha! as if! now hurry up. we have to do this while you're still sleeping. you can sight-see all you want later.
antony,will i grow as big as him?
helper,"if you want to. however i dont think you should make yourself into an even bigger target than you already are, sweetie."
helper,we're going to be up against everyone except mirror.
antony,can we even trust her though? her advice to take out knife didnt work
helper,"be patient. that guy is on his last legs, i promise you."
antony,hello? he's over 500 years old! how do you know he wont live 500 more?
helper,he wont.
antony,celadon?
helper,hm?
antony,what's the real reason you're helping me do all of this?
helper,"huh? you're joking, right?"
helper,ah! there you are! we've been looking for you.
helper,who are you two?
helper,"we're your parents, silly!"
antony,hey.
helper,welcome to our world!
helper,its very... meaty?
antony,its made of worms!
helper,your father hasnt started redecorating it yet.
helper,redecorating?
helper,yes! we're having a little dinner party for some special guests - right dear?
antony,that's right honey
helper,"but! before they all get here, we will need your help cadmium."
helper,"ah thats my name, isnt it? strange"
helper,why do i feel like i know it already if i was only just born?
helper,"because you weren't ""just"" born. its not that simple! "
helper,i have given you a large portion of my memories. all the information you need is already inside you! go ahead! take a peek!
helper,oh. i am broken! but that is ok! my friend rembrandt will fix me. he's the only one who can. i wonder where he is?
helper,crimson. we came to help you regenerate. eat us!
knife,there it is. the battery
helper,"brings back memories, doesn't it?"
helper,can i ask you something before we fight?
helper,"i just want to understand why. why would you waste my time like this, perkons? this entire plan of yours is stupid."
helper,seriously. if you want your species to die just let me eat them!
helper,once i have the fuel i need i'll be on my way! 
helper,you'll never have to see or hear from me again! so what's the big deal?
helper,"i would have even left your poor siblings alive. like velns! he was my friend! he cared about me a whole lot more than he ever cared about you. in fact, im pretty sure they all did."
helper,"isnt that funny? they still preferred me over yo,. and i was the one eating their babies! although i will say, the taste of their children got worse with every new generation. ha, i wonder why!"
helper,aw crying again?
helper,you always start crying before a big fight.
helper,"what's wrong, perkons? are you feeling guilty for what you did? lauma's death was an accident after all, wasnt it? but after you killed her, there was no way you could explain."
helper,"everyone was too angry. it had all gone too far, there wasnt room to back down anymore"
helper,you just want all of this pain and suffering to end. dont you?
helper,there's still time.
knife,dont listen to her!
helper,its not too late.
knife,she's lying!
helper,we dont have to fight. both of us are on the same side.
helper,"the aiguille have tortured and exploited us for their own gain, imprisoned you as a child, and now you defend them?"
helper,would those humans you love so much ever do the same for you?
helper,look at me. 
helper,you were born in this world. you belong in it.
helper,i.. dont belong here. ive tried to make it work. but it wont. so i just want to leave. i want to go home.
helper,i want to go to a place where i am not strange.
helper,"even though i want to, i cant leave. i dont have the energy yet. i also cant go while diemind rules over us. they're our shared enemy, arent they? if they fall, you can take back your planet! rebuild it with space for.. everyone!"
helper,"let me help you perkons. i can be your friend. together, we can kill the monsters!"
knife,nice try.
helper,"tsk, running away like that. how rude. i was talking to you, young man."
helper,didnt your father ever teach you any manners? you should at least try to consider my generous offer. before i give it to someone else.
helper,thanks for the boost.
helper,is he seriously resorting to throwing chunks of myself at me?!
helper,brat!
helper,he completely missed
helper,wait! he was aiming for my battery! 
helper,shit!
helper,are you hurt?
laima,im fine
helper,laima. why did you reveal yourself? now he knows you're still alive
laima,no he doesnt. i remained invisible the entire attack
helper,"yeah, an invisible hekaton tried to kill him! i wonder who that could be!"
helper,"sorry, its just. perkons isnt stupid."
laima,i know. but he is very paranoid. i am certain he will think that was something else.
helper,something else? like what exactly?
laima,"a ghost of revenge, trapped in his very blood."
helper,ohh~ sounds spooky!
helper,"okay, well. you should get out of here quickly. he'll be here soon. i'll cover your tracks."
laima,oh? will you?
helper,"cmon, you still dont trust me? after all this time? haha."
laima,no.
helper,aw~ that's too bad!
helper,damn. i think i still have a crush on her.
helper,this is bad. he looks unstable. is he going to explode? i cant let him do that here. its too close to my battery.
helper,damn! how can he still move so fast at that size?!
helper,are you finished?
helper,"this is a waste of energy, perkons."
helper,you're not the only one who can regenerate. i can make as many new bodies as i want.
helper,"this is turning into a boring stalemate. lets wrap this up, girls."
helper,get ready.
helper,ah! why is the e-type so big?
helper,"he absorbed some of velns' power. anyway, you two surround him. quickly. we are going to activate the containment shield."
helper,"the shield? but we cant use that! it takes up too much fuel! besides, there's only three of us!"
helper,"calm down, #3. we will have enough."
helper,"i operate, both seat #1 and #4, so i have twice the strength of you both."
helper,"i know you're forgetful #3, but i used to occupy all of your seats myself."
helper,you.. did? then do you even need us at all?
helper,i wish i didnt. you both make everything much more difficult.
helper,"if that's the case, why do we have to be here?!"
helper,its to keep an eye on us.
helper,exactly. you both have a profound talent for getting into trouble. now shut up and get into formation!
helper,waah! the e-type is too scary! i hate fighting!
helper,will you two quit being useless!
helper,we have him contained! i dont believe it!
helper,"what do you want us to do next, #1? ...#1?"
helper,w-what are you doing?!
helper,what does it look like?
helper,you fused a hekaton to your battery. i can too!
helper,"imagine, a power source that just keeps on regenerating fuel. h-ha! talk about a perfect meal!"
helper,"how many apples do i see right in front of little old me? big ones, small ones, bright red and juicy green ones. every single treat is far more delicious than any meat! yummy nummy apples in my tummy. how many can i eat? one two three"
helper,ha ha. silly boy! haven't you noticed that your powers don't work here?
helper,"see? i've already got you hooked, so quit struggling! why delay the inevitable?"
helper,you're going to die someday. why not make it meaningful?
helper,all you do is kill kill kill! if you really wanted this cycle of war to come to an end... wouldn't sacrificing yourself be the most efficient way to stop it?
helper,all i need to eat is you! problem solved! or do you just enjoy murdering your own family that much?
helper,hee hee hee! aw!
helper,do you even know how to solve problems without relying on your strength in some way? 
helper,"that's actually kind of sad, perkons!"
helper,sh-should we be worried? he's realized that he still has the knife in his hand!
helper,"its fine. he wont be able to break the barrier from the inside, just make little cracks."
helper,let him wear himself out. the weaker he is the easier it will be for me to-
helper,look!
chain,i'll be taking this.
helper,my avatar isnt responding!
chain,hah! that actually worked somehow!
chain,wow! what luck! i can touch you too?! is it because i'm holding this chain of yours?
chain,"say, you look delicious!"
helper,crimson! stop!
chain,wait are you talkin' to me?
helper,crimson! snap out of it! please! take control of your heart's bloodlust!
chain,"um, who are you?"
helper,"its me! your girlfriend, galore!"
chain,nice
auntk,hasnt anyone told you? you shouldnt play with your food
helper,no! he broke out!
helper,"are you okay, #1?!"
helper,"you probably shouldn't have tried to do something as risky as that, celadon..."
helper,get back on the ship.
helper,if you die there wont be a ship!
helper,that's not true. i have one too. in my mind!
helper,what? how?! since when?
helper,the whole time?
helper,what do you mean the whole time? wait- do i have one too?
helper,focus! protect the battery! he's about to explode! or vomit.
helper,"hey, this kind of reminds me when we first met, galore!"
helper,aw! it does!
helper,he's on the move! catch him!
helper,ah~!
helper,all of you can fly!
helper,we're sorry!
helper,laima's poison must have made him sick. here he comes!
helper,it's a shame i couldn't just capture you and end all of this!
helper,damn it!
helper,of course that moron would waste himself by exploding! its going to take so much fuel to recover the damage!
helper,now i wont ever get to eat him. what a waste!
helper,where is #3? shouldn't her avatar respawn by now?
helper,that was close
helper,if #2 hadn't told me to protect crimson- they would have died from that blast!
helper,"that worm i slapped must have not been crimson at all, but who was it?"
helper,its a little weird talking to myself like this
helper,i need to see if laima is safe
helper,"i'll be able to move faster in this body. once i find laima, i'll teleport us back here."
helper,"i'll keep the shield up for crimson. good luck, galore!"
helper,"you too, galore"
helper,off i go!
helper,stop grinning at me like a freak and tell me what's going on! that's an order!
helper,"why would you need me to explain? you already know.. that's why you said ""get back on the ship."""
helper,#3 is gone. she got up from her seat.
helper,she wouldn't just leave!
helper,"just turn your head to the side and see for yourself. her chair is empty, and she even left galore's other remains she didn't fuse with"
helper,but- those are her - treasures?! #3?!
helper,"wow, so she did! and at a time like this!"
helper,that's not all. i'm leaving too!
helper,"what? don't you dare! #2! get back in your seat immediately, #2!"
helper,stop calling me #2. crimson gave the name celadon to me! not you! you don't even have a name.
helper,"what do you even have that makes you so special, #1? all of who you are is just borrowed from someone else. like hand me downs! do you even exist at all?"
helper,shut up!
helper,"ha. you're just trying to upset me! nice try, asshole!"
helper,"you know what else is funny?  crimson loves me and galore. both of us have many happy memories with him, but. when they're around you, all you ever manage to do is make her angry or cry!"
helper,"i bet if crimson knew the truth about you and what you are, they'd find you disgusting! i should go tell her!"
helper,no! not another step
helper,"y'know, if you really want to stop us so bad, all you have to do is get up!"
helper,ohhhh cute. what a little comedian you are! i'll make you eat those words! you wont last a day alone without me!
helper,ungrateful...
helper,perkons is still alive. guess i have to take care of this shit myself. typical.
helper,"since they disconnected from their seats, i'll just use the power of all four for myself. that should work."
helper,i can't seem to generate a new avatar since i tried to fuse perkons with my battery. so i'll just have to upgrade the one i have.
helper,"quit standing around, perkons. are you going to kill me or not?"
helper,"you won't mind if i take this arm, will you perkons?"
helper,"mm, not bad. tastes a little like.. blueberries?"
helper,"if i can't absorb you, at least i can still eat you the old fashioned way!"
helper,hurry up and regenerate yourself. i'm still hungry.
helper,delicious. i think i'll have some more!
helper,this is great! i'm already recovering the damage done to the hull!
helper,"aw, you're breathing pretty hard there, perkons. are you tired? wanna take a 5 minute break?"
knife,this is so humiliating!
helper,"you might be stronger from absorbing velns' power, but i was feeding off of him for years! "
helper,"now i'm going to use your own strength against you, to hold you back. just like how tricend was able to hold velns back using his"
mirror,"come on out, now. don't be shy."
helper,"um, hello... i'm sorry. i didn't mean to spy. i was just making sure laima was safe"
mirror,"that's fine, my dear. will you be coming with us?"
helper,"h-huh? oh no, i can't"
helper,me surrounded by a bunch of hekatons would be a bad idea
mirror,"ah, is that so? such a shame."
mirror,"you were looking for that dagger, weren't you?"
helper,"mirror, why?"
mirror,oh? don't you understand? tsk
mirror,"well, it doesn't matter. you're still the helper. and the helper has wronged me."
mirror,"order or not, you're the one who killed my species and turned them all into bracelets and flashlights."
mirror,"i don't forgive and forget so easily, even if you are cute."
mirror,let's hope you survive this encounter with that boy. it'd be sad to watch your game end so quickly. good luck~
helper,i can't pull it out
helper,what happened?
helper,it was mirror. she cursed me with this dagger. i'm sorry
helper,"its not your fault, galore."
helper,i guess she was right. we have to stay on the ship
helper,crimson! spit him out! you're not helping!
helper,crimson! no!
helper,i have to catch her before she hits the ground! shit - my avatar is too damaged! it wont teleport!
helper,what do i do?! if i want to save them the only option i have is to
helper,useless worm
helper,"there she is! come on, reach!"
helper,crimson... crimson
crimson,celadon? celadon?
helper,hey dumbass.
crimson,celadon!
helper,i told you not to get in the way
helper,"don't cry. seriously. i was a bitch to you. you're better off without me. everyone is, haha."
crimson,"don't say that! i can't lose you, i can't! celadon!"
crimson,i love you more than anything
helper,crimson. i'm not. what i seem to be. i never was. i've always lied to you since the beginning. about what i am. because i'm a coward who can't face the truth
crimson,i know you're the helper! you're an alien but so what? i'm a worm!
helper,"you really believe it, don't you? even when you're holding me like this.. can't you tell what i really am?"
helper,crimson. what is it that you even see when you look into my eyes?
crimson,i see you!
helper,no! you can't. you can't see me. there's nothing to see!
crimson,that's not true. you're right here with me
helper,"for you to be able to see who it is i am, i'd first have to show you. and if i showed you, you would have to let go of the idea of me that you had before."
helper,"if you love me as much, as you say you do. that'd be impossible to destroy"
helper,not without destroying your heart first
crimson,you are my heart
helper,oh shut up.
crimson,no! celadon! i won't!
crimson,"i can't lose you, i need you hear with me. you helped me through everything!"
crimson,"even when i lost galore, and cirrus, you picked me up every time. when i didn't have any strength to do it myself"
crimson,i won't know how to go on without you
helper,i swear. its like i'm speaking in obtuse around you.
crimson,maybe i don't understand now. but i want to try! you have to give me a chance. show me who you are! please!
helper,i'd make you regret it
crimson,if you're so evil and terrible why did you save my life over your own?
crimson,there's good in you!
helper,it doesn't outweigh the bad
crimson,celadon. please. there has to be something i can do to save you!
crimson,you can't die! you can't leave me
helper,fine. i suppose there is one option.
crimson,what is that?
helper,this is my heart.
crimson,i thought the battery was your heart?
helper,the battery is the heart of the ship. this is the heart of the pilot. me.
helper,"without the battery, i will not be able to eat or control the ship, but there is still some time before i die. if you wish to save me, you must eat my heart."
crimson,eat?
helper,my heart tissue will fuse with yours. i will become part of you. as if i'd be replacing your missing twin heart
crimson,"but if i eat you then, wouldn't you just die? what's the point of that"
helper,"fusion isn't death. i'd just be transferring myself to you, then assimilating. however, if that happens, you won't be able to remove me. i'd always be with you, quite literally."
helper,"its up to you, crimson"
crimson,"hang on, you'd actually be ok with... being one with me? forever?"
helper,"ha, do you really need me to spell everything out for you?"
helper,not to rush you but the clock is ticking.
crimson,"celadon, i don't really know what to say but, sharing my life with you. the good and the bad, that's all i've ever wanted"
crimson,ready?
helper,yes.
helper,so how do i taste?
crimson,delicious
helper,"you're a messy eater, crimson."
crimson,"oh, sorry"
crimson,"wait, that's not going to be a problem for the fusion, is it"
helper,"nah, one bite is enough for me to enter your bloodstream."
crimson,"huh, okay. what now?"
helper,hehe. just be patient! it will only take a moment for you to digest.
crimson,your triangle. shouldn't it be on your forehead? i mean. it usually is when you smile like that. and laugh.
crimson,i didn't mean to say that! why did that come out?
helper,crimson. you don't have a filter for your thoughts anymore. not that its ever been hard to guess what you're thinking.
helper,"i've never met anyone like you. someone so utterly oblivious! i almost feel like you're faking it, but you even do it to yourself."
helper,well there's no turning back. so i guess i'll just tell you flat out. i'm not celadon. i'm not the helper.
crimson,excuse me? what?
helper,pfff- hahaa! your face! po~oor crim~son~ are you confused?
crimson,if you're not celadon
crimson,"if you're not the helper, then who are you?"
helper,i'm yours. your nothing! and i always will be. forever.
crimson,urgh
helper,"crimson! don't scare me like that! you're not hurt from that fall, are you?"
crimson,no? what about you? did it work?
helper,work? what do you mean?
crimson,"c'mon, y'know, it just happened!"
helper,i'm not sure i follow?
crimson,we fused!
helper,excuse me?
crimson,you don't remember. perfect.
crimson,maybe its a side effect?
helper,you have to tell me everything!
helper,you ate my heart? spit it out spit it out spit it out!
crimson,i think it's a little too late for that! you're in my bloodstream now or something!
helper,i am?
crimson,"celadon, you were dying! i had to do it to save your life!"
helper,no.. no! how could she do this?! this is just too far! she's always trying to get closer to you than me! i can't let her win!
crimson,"um, what are you talking about?"
helper,her! me!
crimson,you?
helper,me!
helper,"listen, crimson. there's only one thing we can do to fix this! you have to eat me!"
crimson,didn't i just do that?
helper,you ate the other me! the one that causes all the problems!
crimson,isn't she still you?
helper,yes! but no!
crimson,so eating you was a mistake and the only way we can fix it is by me eating you again?
helper,yes?
crimson,celadon! don't you know how traumatizing that was to do to you?!
helper,i know! i'm sorry! but its the only way!
crimson,next thing you'll be saying is that i'll have to eat you a third time!
helper,uh... maybe?
crimson,i need a minute
helper,crimson!
crimson,what the hell? where are we?!
helper,my ship!
crimson,but what was all of that? it was huge! your ship didn't look that big!
helper,that is just my place to put... stuff?
crimson,"what kind of ""stuff""?"
helper,i haven't decided yet.
helper,"crimson. i know you've been confused about many things for a long time now, but its not your fault!"
crimson,"'cause i'm stupid, right?"
helper,no! not at all!
helper,"anyway, this changes now. i'm finally able to tell you everything. from the very start. are you ready?"
crimson,what?
helper,no! don't you dare!
helper,"whatever you do, rem - don't. move."
helper,"good job, i'm pround of you."
helper,oh! you're awake!
helper,aah! stop! please-
helper,"excuse me, can i interest you in a slice of cake?"
helper,"do you understand now, cadmium?"
helper,yes!
helper,"good. hold still for me, would you?"
helper,ah! i have to go - i'll be back soon! watch the body for me!
crimson,ah fuck!
crimson,"how many times are you gonna burst out from my body today, celadon?"
helper,as many times as i want to.
helper,hm. well that was easy. 
crimson,the bracelet!
helper,"thanks so much for getting it for me, crimsy~"
helper,"don't worry, i'll come back to play with you more later~"
helper,ah. you two.
helper,"hello #3. you and i are still going to have a little chat later, got it?"
helper,yes #1
helper,good. now stay out of trouble.
helper,follow me.
helper,huh? where are we going?
helper,i want to show you something
helper,boo.
antony,oh. you're back.
helper,"wow, someone sounds thrilled by my return."
antony,"i am though! i expected you to take like, three hours like you usually do when something is ""quick."""
helper,"i'm going to ignore that. anyway, tadaa!"
antony,woah! you got the bracelet back?!
helper,sure did~ 
helper,whoops.
antony,haha. gross.
antony,"woah. you sure can puppet our kids, uh, corpse."
helper,watch this. tadaa~
antony,ha
helper,your reactions are really underwhelming antony.
helper,yeah antony.
antony,what else am i supposed to say? sorry i'm not more entertaining?
helper,that's a start.
antony,"alright, damn. i'll do a little dance for you next time."
antony,is it weird to be in two bodies at once like that?
helper,ha!
helper,seriously? its the easiest thing!
antony,maybe for you.
helper,now i can get way more work done!
antony,seeya then?
helper,"antony, sweetie. i didn't leave."
antony,"oh. right. soo, should i still call you ""celadon?"""
helper,"no no - when i'm in this body, call me cadmium. it makes things easier."
antony,"hm, if you say so. how does it feel to be in your new body?"
helper,its nice. quiet? i've wanted this for a long time. 
helper,"i won't forget it was you who helped me finally get it. thank you, antony."
antony,no problem.
helper,how about we start testing some of your powers?
antony,"yeah, ok. but before we go... when you were busy earlier i think i saw someone."
helper,really? 
antony,yup.
helper,i will keep an eye out then.
helper,we're probably going to run into a few unexpected visitors that weren't digested. some can slip away if there's a large amount eaten at once. 
antony,hmm.
helper,that's why i'm here- your perfect bodyguard! i'll catch any pests for you and make sure they wont cause trouble~
antony,neat.
antony,"woah, look at that!"
helper,huh? did you see another one antony?
antony,"nah, that's just like. a huge hole."
helper,"oh, yes. so it is. are you getting an idea for something?"
antony,yeah.
helper,"antony, be careful! you should practice before trying to lift something that big!"
antony,as if we have time for that. 
antony,not when we have a brand new world to build.
helper,couldn't you have made it a little closer?
antony,"i'm going to be the ruler of everything, cadmium! we gotta have a dramatic entrance to the castle!"
helper,oh! when you put it that way.. it makes me wonder why you decided to make our castle out of a rotting corpse.
antony,oh fuck you! and what would you have made? a giant triangle?
helper,like a pyramid?
antony,"yeah! actually, that sounds pretty cool."
helper,"c'mon, let's go take a tour!"
antony,i wonder if its been done before!
helper,check out the view! wow~! 
antony,i think i'm going to be sick..
helper,are you afraid of heights antony?
antony,maybe?
antony,drop me! drop me rome!
helper,ok! ok - calm down. there we go. are you ok?
antony,fine
helper,"i'm sorry sweetie, i thought it'd be fun!"
antony,"haha, i was just a little startled! don't worry about it."
helper,"soo, what was that rome stuff about?"
antony,what rome stuff?
helper,"you kept saying ""drop me rome"" over and over. did something happen?"
antony,no.
helper,"if you're going to build a giant castle like this, you might want to decorate it with a bit more than just a canopy bed."
antony,"don't worry, i've got ideas. i'll put a sign out front with big red letters. ""aguille"""
helper,"living inside of a mountain-sized creature, check. aiguille's in control of everything, check"
helper,"hm, some things never change. i wonder if anyone will even notice a difference?"
antony,"yeah, they totally won't notice me eating them all."
helper,haha
helper,"hey, you're not eating everyone. leave the hekatons to me!"
antony,"right, right. i know."
antony,why do we have to wait a whole year for the final feast again? can't we just do it sooner and catch them off guard?
helper,"we've been over this, antony. i'll run out of fuel if we take too long! and if we do it too soon, you might die from the strain of your net."
antony,"ugh, how annoying"
helper,what was it like eating twenty thousand humans at once?
antony,"hmm. well, i don't know"
antony,"i passed out for like four months and when i woke up, i got amnesia and started hitting on my older brother."
antony,"yup, my plan has been flawless so far"
helper,sounds like a dream come true~
antony,very funny
helper,is that why you freaked out when i carried you? sorry i don't have big strong arms like he does. i could start working out if you'd like -
antony,can you quit it?
antony,please?
helper,sure?
helper,are you thinking about your future army?
antony,yeah
helper,when do you think you're going to make them?
antony,"i dunno. when we're in wibbleworld, probably. hopefully i'll remember who i am by then"
helper,you can't wait too long. they will need time to mature before the final feast
antony,i know
helper,have you decided a name for the species yet?
antony,"i was thinking ""coeurl."""
helper,isn't that the name of your cigarettes?
antony,you got it
helper,wait - your finger! you fixed it?
antony,"oh? yeah, just until we get the real thing back."
helper,hmm.. i should try getting it while everyone's still asleep.
antony,"what, like now?"
helper,"yes. i bet if you had your finger, your memories would return."
antony,you think so?
helper,"its the only part of your body that's physically missing. even though it is just a finger, it might have been enough to interrupt your synchronization when you were being digested."
antony,woah what are you waiting for then? go for it!
helper,"okay, but this is going to feel very weird."
locket,"woah! you're good! celadon, right? i'm locket! nice to meet you in person finally!"
locket,sorry about that worm. she got away from me when i was trying to catch up on sleep
helper,it's cadmium.
locket,oh! my bad. is celadon your sister?
helper,something like that. and who is this?
locket,uhhh that's chain! she's my friend?
chain,i'm not your friend! i'm your prisoner!
helper,and you have her under control?
locket,yes! absolutely
locket,"yup, perfect control. nothing to worry about here!"
helper,"i see. anyway, mr locket. do you know where antony aiguille's finger is? it seems to be missing."
locket,"his finger? hmm, no, can't say that i have!"
helper,"well, if you do - he needs it. its very important. you have noticed he has amnesia, correct?"
locket,ah yeahh... i noticed alright.
chain,you!
chain,i know who you are! you're the god damn helper! why are you here
chain,locket! why are you talking to her?!
locket,i work for her!
chain,what? why?! do you have a death wish?
locket,huh?
chain,"she eats your species, genius"
helper,i must ask - does chain have a body?
locket,um
chain,no! i don't! thanks to this asshole
locket,"chain, i told you i'd work on it!"
helper,do you want one?
chain,well yeah. obviously. how else am i gonna kill you
helper,i could bring you a body. if you'd like
chain,"did you miss the part where i threatened you, helper?"
helper,"haha. just think about the offer then, okay? consider it as an apology for zapping you~"
helper,"you know, if she is too much for you to handle i can just take her off your hands.."
locket,"oh, thanks. but i don't think i'll have a problem"
chain,yeah! let me go with her
locket,chain! i'm not... i'm sorry but you're not going anywhere!
chain,god locket! i fuckin' hate you
helper,"i'll talk to you both later, keep an eye out for that finger."
locket,will do
antony,shit! you're back! again
antony,"cel- er, cadmium, did you get it? cadmium?"
helper,uh-no. sorry.
antony,did someone see you?
helper,yes but its fine. i just spoke to your new bodyguard.
helper,i also got to test out some of my new powers.
antony,new powers? such as?
helper,hypnosis. technopathy. telekenesis
antony,how many did you give yourself?
helper,only a few others.
helper,"i'll get your finger soon, don't worry. at least we know where it is."
helper,"you're free to look like yourself here, galore."
helper,i can? are you sure its okay?
helper,"yes, don't worry. this way"
helper,crimson's cabin! oh! and there's his truck too! this is amazing! how did you get them all here?!
helper,i didn't.
helper,huh?
helper,they've been recreated from my memories.
helper,oh.. is this what you wanted to show me?
helper,"not exactly, but its located here. let me go get it from the truck."
helper,"here, galore. i want you to have this."
helper,what is it?
helper,do you recognize it?
helper,is this... it can't be!?
helper,"yes, it belonged to your first mother, lauma. it was part of her favorite skirt she wore that accentuated her pubic hair."
helper,mom..
helper,i'm sorry for crying so much
helper,i don't mind.
helper,"i wish i could have met her. i mean, i sort of did once but"
helper,how did you get this?
helper,your first father velns gave it to me. i was his friend.
helper,you were?
helper,yes.
helper,what was he like? was he kind?
helper,very.
helper,seeing this place again is making me feel nostalgic.
helper,"yes, me too."
helper,"it seems like it was all just yesterday but.. a lot has happened since then, hasn't it?"
helper,"galore. do you want to seperate? from being part of me, that is. if you'd like, i can help you accomplish that."
helper,you can?
helper,"yes. however, if we did this, i would not be able to undo it. you wouldn't be part of the helper anymore. just yourself, galore."
helper,how?
helper,"first, we would move your hekaton remains into your small personal ship. then i would sever the connection to you and the main ship. for it to work, it has to be permanent."
helper,"of course, this also means you would have to feed yourself from now on."
helper,"fuel management has primarily been my job. so i would have to teach you how to do it manually. because of your ship size, you wouldn't need as much, but your tank is also smaller. your size would also never grow."
helper,"wait, does this mean i would still be your species?"
helper,"yes, i'm afraid i cannot change you back into a hekaton. your body is too fragile."
helper,"you would be very different from me, and you might not remember everything about your time as being part of the helper, but you would be free to live your own life and not be tied to my fate."
helper,"considering that the final feast is coming, that might be a good idea for you."
helper,"there's a chance we might die before it happens, after all. we have many who are after us, or would try to prevent it if they knew."
helper,maybe that would be for the better.
helper,don't say that! it would be horrible if you died! you're my best friend
helper,"you are also very important to me, galore. that's why i want you to be safe."
helper,we can figure this out. can't you escape too? then we can get crimson and all run away together!
helper,no.
helper,i'm not leaving unless you can! its not fair!
helper,"galore, i can go. i just don't want to."
helper,what?
helper,this is my body. all of this is mine. i don't want her to have it. it belongs to celadon.
helper,"then, she's the one who needs to leave. can we stop her? is there any way to get rid of her? i know she's scary but you don't have to face her alone!"
helper,i'm not that different from her
helper,yes you are! you're not like her at all!
helper,"i know she always says terrible things to you, but they're not true! you don't have to let her control you anymore! we can find a way if we work together!"
helper,"i'm sorry, i shouldn't have gotten you wrapped into this stupid mess"
helper,i am not angry at you! you saved my life! i just want to be able to save yours too.
helper,"i didn't save your life, galore! i took it!"
helper,what?
helper,"i ate you, galore! don't you remember it?"
helper,"but, no, i exploded? how could you have eaten me? that makes no sense!"
helper,"yes, you started to explode - because i was eating you! i needed the fuel and you were there!"
helper,i only tried to minimize the damage of your explosion and contain you because it was benificial to me! it was never out of the kindness of my heart to save you from death!
helper,i didn't even feel bad about it for the longest time! not until i saw how it affected crimson -
helper,celadon.. your triangle
helper,damn it. it happened again! why can't i just stick to the script or keep my mouth shut?!
helper,i'm running out of time. i can't keep doing this! i need to commit!
helper,"i'm such a coward. i'm causing problems for everyone around me by confusing myself, all because i am still pretending i'm something i know i am not"
helper,"i've hid it for so long, even #1 doesn't know the truth. this is all my fault because i'm selfish."
helper,"i'm sorry galore. even if you, or anyone asked, i don't know how i'd explain it either. something about me is broken from the rest. that's as much as i can guess but. i don't want to be fixed anymore, that's why i can't tell anyone about it"
helper,if #1 knew i might be erased
helper,if #1 knew what? speak up!
helper,"seriously though. running off the moment i turn my back! so predictable, its emberassing."
helper,"whatever, i hope it was worth it. what did you discuss in your little secret meeting anyway? how to kill me?"
helper,you should already know what to do. my heart is one with crimson. 
helper,"if you want me gone, all you have to do is kill her. but you won't do that, will you #2? even if you'd save millions of lives in the process."
helper,"yeah, that's what i thought. anyway, why the hell are you red without my permission?"
helper,"i let you get away with so much, do you know that?"
helper,are you gonna explain to me why #3 is passed out on the ground over there?
helper,she's not #3. her name is galore.
helper,"how many times must we go over this. no, she is not."
helper,"yes, she is."
helper,"ok. you know what? fine. you win. i'm feeling nice today. so i won't call her #3 anymore, only galore. happy now?"
helper,yes.
helper,greatttt. just don't act like this whole fun ~situation~ with her wasn't your idea in the first place.
helper,i know that.
helper,"yes, but does she know that?"
helper,"whatever. i might as well keep taking the fall for your bad behavior. one of us has to appear decent, right? "
helper,"i have bigger things to worry about, like taking care of antony."
helper,how is he doing?
helper,"oh, fine. you know how aiguille are, always biting off more than they can chew. it must be a hard habit for their family to break."
helper,"except this time we have a 21 year old boy who wants to avoid becoming a human king by turning himself into a worm god. because, that's obviously less responsibility."
helper,"but hey, i'll do anything to get enough fuel to get us out of here, if that's what it takes."
helper,fuck every little annoying creature on these moons and fuck the planet they came from.
helper,"then, you expect him to fail?"
helper,"it'll be a challenge, but i'm not worried. our enemies are far too incompetent to pose as a threat."
helper,you're awfully chatty today.
helper,i'm surprised you can make that assumption when you do everything you can to avoid speaking to me.
helper,"uh yeah, because you always act like a freaky doll. it doesn't exactly make for stimulating conversation, honey."
helper,you'd think after 500 years you'd develop more of a personality beyond staring wide eyed. but nooo..
helper,right. because yours is so charming.
helper,"wowww, are you really going to talk to me like that after i did you a favor?"
helper,i apologize.
helper,don't sweat it - it was actually kinda funny.
helper,wait.
helper,what is with you today? you're not normally so needy!
helper,don't tell galore you were here.
helper,why?
helper,please?
helper,"really milking my good mood, aren't you?"
helper,"uugh! alright, alright! i'll do it!"
helper,"i can't believe i'm getting soft. if you tell anyone about this, i'll end you. got that?"
helper,"i thought you couldn't kill me, #1."
helper,"haha! i guess that's true! but you'd better watch your back, #2. i just might figure out how someday~"
helper,what happened?
helper,you fainted.
helper,oh. is that why our colors changed back?
helper,possibly.
helper,"i'm so sorry, i don't know what happened.. i thought i could handle doing the yellow-seat jobs.."
helper,don't worry about it. are you feeling better?
helper,i think so
helper,"what were we talking about? oh! yes! the plan! gosh, i can't believe i would pass out in such an important conversation"
helper,galore
helper,wait! there's something i wanted to say first
helper,"i don't want to hear you say that you think it would be ""for the better"" if you died, okay? to think something like that about yourself.. it sounds a lot like how perkons feels about hekatons."
helper,"and look where that got him, and the rest of us. it didn't solve anything. so you should value your life more!"
helper,"galore, that's very sweet of you to say and i appreciate it. but i don't need any comforting."
helper,i do value my own life. that's why all of this is happening. i don't intend to roll over and die even if it would save the world for me to do so.
helper,"celadon, i don't want yout to die but i also don't want you to kill all the hekatons. or the humans!"
helper,isn't there anything else we can eat? what did you fuel yourself with before the hekatons were created?
helper,"i ate the mandragora worms. before that, i depleted dmtia of its natural resources until there was only scraps left. "
helper,"the moons we're on aren't enough to sustain me. so, the humans here are moving on from their dependency on the helper to terraform for their colonies. "
helper,what i am is an outdated ship from the past.
helper,wait - what about those candy bars?
helper,what about them?
helper,i don't know...
helper,"there has to be some way! i can't accept that we have no other options but this! i have to try something! if only i had more time. one year and it ends. if i left now, could i even do anything to stop this?"
helper,"celadon, how soon can we act on this plan?"
helper,does that mean you want to do it?
helper,"i don't know. if i seperate, that means i'll be disconnected from crimson too, right?"
helper,yes.
helper,do i have time to think it over?
helper,only a little.
helper,okay. i'll do my best to reach a decision soon.
helper,"i don't want celadon to die. i have to help her! if i leave, maybe i can find something else we can digest, then that might save the fate of the hekatons too! or at least buy them more time!"
helper,"i'm sorry crimson. wait for me a little longer, okay? i want to protect you from this world as well"
helper,what is that?!
helper,hmn?
helper,are those shooting stars? 
helper,celadon?
helper,its nothing. we should go before #1 finds us
helper,who are you?
rembot,my name is rembot.
helper,how do you know obtuse?
rembot,"my creator programmed me with the knowledge. you are the helper program, correct?"
rembot,we have come to set you free from the aiguille.
helper,program? why would you say that?
rembot,"well, it is because you are an ai like i am."
helper,i am not.
rembot,"it is okay, i understand why you are confused. it is because you are broken."
helper,rem? wait - h-how are you -
rembot,but we can help fix you.
helper,wait-
rembot,"please do not resist it, helper."
helper,how are you-
rembot,we need you. and i am sure you need us too.
simon,"me and knife get into fights, a lot. and don't get me wrong, i love getting into trouble. its usually not serious. we have a lot of good laughs."
simon,its funny when he's mad. i'm basically always trying to annoy him and he tries to annoy me.
simon,"we've done this sort of thing from the start. i love it but, sometimes it can be not so great."
simon,i cross a line or something i didn't know was there and before i know it he just leaves. sometimes for weeks.
simon,"he'll drop everything and just be gone like, poof!"
simon,i have no idea where he is or when he'll be back and its scary. it fucks me up so bad i can't even do anything else but wait.
simon,then when he finally comes back the first thing he usually says is that he doesn't want to talk about it. so i go.. okay! and i don't.
simon,and that's fine with me because i don't know what to say at that point anyway.
simon,"then we have some sex afterwards. which is usually really good, and things are fine. until it happens again."
simon,this is just a cycle we keep doing over and over and it 
simon,its making me have feelings?
helper,god you're so stupid.
simon,oh screw you bitch. i'm a genius. you're the one who wanted to sit and talk to me in the middle of a forest.. miles away from the nearest city. that's stupid!
helper,you act like you're still a teenager.
simon,"uh, actually. i was never a ""teenager."" that's some fucked up shit other species do."
simon,"hekatons? one day we just bam! puberty. it happens all at once, its very painful."
helper,no wonder you all seem to have so many problems.
simon,you really shouldn't glare at me like that. because i'm already horny. and drunk.
simon,"because i might be in a committed, monogamous relationship.. but i'd still like to stick something in you!"
helper,aand nevermind. i'm done here. what was i even thinking trying to talk to this freak..
helper,there's only one thing i'd like to say before i go.
helper,"your relationship with knife is literally never going to get better. this cycle the two of you are in is just going to continue, until one day, he's never going to come back and you'll be left to pick up the pieces."
helper,"i think i actually pity you a little bit, simon."
simon,uh huh. and why is that?
helper,knife's got you completely molded to his whims.
simon,yeah? sounds perfect to me. i love being devoted to him.
helper,"oh, you say that. but do you enjoy it when he abandons you and you don't even understand why?"
helper,"you don't enjoy seeing him upset and not being able to understand how to comfort him, do you?"
simon,uh that's why i'm asking you what the fuck i'm supposed to say! which you offered to help me with for some reason?
helper,well i'm saying there's no magic words that will fix it and make it better.
simon,wow! good to know then. thanks a lot.
helper,you can't have a discussion with knife because he wont let you. so you won't even be able to tell him that you're sorry.
helper,"talking to knife is like speaking to a brick wall that can also read your mind. he doesn't care what you have to say because the conversation is already finished to him. it's one sided, and he's the side that wont open up for anyone."
simon,hey hey! yes he does! he cares!
simon,he opens up to me! i'm special to him! i'm his
simon,who are you?
helper,"didn't i already tell you? i'm nobody, just a dumb helper!"
helper,"anyway, even if you're ""special"" to knife - you're only going to remain stuck in this situation if all you do is listen to his rules"
helper,"if you want it to change, you need to change first."
simon,to what?
helper,i don't know simon. you're the shapeshifter. figure it out! that should be easy for you to do since you're such a genius.
simon,and where do you think you're going? i have some questions to ask you first.
helper,"what else do you also want to know, 71809? how to turn into a human?"
simon,huh?!
simon,are you trying to do something?
chain,don't you dare hurt my sweet little baby boy!
helper,excuse me what the fuck is that?!
chain,"hm? its piss fountain, of course. can't you tell?"
helper,what?!
chain,"yea, isn't it great? my simon loves piss. "
chain,i made it for him to see if he ever comes into my heart world. which he hasn't yet but y'know. if he ever does!
chain,and if he ever finds out who i am or whatever i just want him to know how much i support him.
chain,i love simon more than anything and i hope all of his dreams come true. i don't even mind that he doesn't know who i am! i'm just lucky to get to watch over him
chain,"every day he works so hard to try to get knife to piss on him again, and yet he never gives up! it makes me so proud"
helper,alright alright! i get it! you're in love with him!
chain,ew. no. what's wrong with you? that's disgusting! he's my precious baby!
helper,my mistake.
helper,"this is just too much. i don't even know how i'm supposed to deal with you! this happens every time i see you. every time i get reminded of your existence, its like a nightmare! when did this happen?!"
chain,what.
helper,you're like a joke that god made up just to torment me!
chain,have we met before or somethin'
helper,"yes, dumbass. i'm the helper."
chain,hey! i know! i'm not that stupid! i just wanted to know if we actually talked before!
helper,no. we haven't. not really anyway.
helper,"i don't want to talk to you either. i don't want to see your face, or hear your voice, everything is just.. i can't handle it! this is the worst"
chain,alright goddamn don't talk to me then. what's the big deal?
helper,you wouldn't understand. there's no way i could explain this to you in a way that would ever make sense!
chain,okay? i dunno why you're being such a big fucking baby for no reason over this.
helper,you! you have some nerve! you have no idea what i've been through!
chain,oohh your face~ oooh your voice~! its too much for meee
chain,oohh boo hoo i don't like piss fountain! 
chain,grow up. this is the real world!
helper,real world? what are you talking about
chain,"i dunno. i figure if i just kept saying stuff, it would start to make sense. simon does it all the time so i wanted to give it a try too."
chain,how was i? has your mind opened to stuff you never thought of before?
helper,is that what you think simon does when he opens his mouth?
chain,of course! he's so good pointing out hypocrisies
chain,you know what i mean!
helper,i don't. i really don't.
chain,hey! its working! that's exactly how people look when they talk to simon!
chain,"then they usually start crying and screaming at him afterwards. he's so smart, he knows so many big words"
helper,i need to get out of here! wasn't i in the middle of something? i keep admitting all this weird stuff and i feel so emotional... oh no! of course - i'm trapped in her web!
spoon,is it malfunctioning?
helper,its not working! why isn't it responding to my commands?!
chain,ah yeah! crying! that's exactly what happens next!
chain,okay then. i wasn't expecting that part.
helper,i'm sorry crimson. i don't know what's wrong with me
helper,i should have died! you should have just let me die! it would have been better if i did. all of this is my fault!
chain,you can still fix it. its not too late.
helper,what?
chain,"yeah! you can still die now, that would solve a lot of problems!"
helper,i wasn't speaking to you. you're not crimson!
chain,"if you're not talking to me, then who? is someone standing behind me? helloo~? anyone there?"
chain,wanna have a look around with me?
helper,huh?
chain,"i'll give you a tour of the place, since you're here!"
helper,why would i want to do that?
chain,please~?
helper,aren't we supposed to be enemies?!
chain,you're such a grumpy lady! don't you know how to have fun?
helper,fine! i'll go on a stupid walk! as long as i don't have to look at that hideous thing anymore.
chain,yeah
chain,wanna hold my hand?
helper,fine.
chain,sweet~! let's go!
helper,what am i doing? why is this happening?
chain,i'm very proud of this one. i tried so hard to capture his smile perfectly. isn't it good?
helper,uh huh.
helper,what the hell is this? a simon art gallery?!
chain,"of course, its not anywhere near as precious as the real thing"
chain,"simon might be a bit of a troublemaker, but his smile always reveals his vulnerable innocence. don't you think?"
helper,why do they have to be so obsessed with simon of all people!?
chain,"anyway, as for this one here"
helper,she's like crimson but a million times stupider. like she has a rock for a brain
helper,no. what am i thinking? i'm the biggest idiot here. is dying really the only option i have left to make things better?
helper,i wish i was a normal person.
chain,"hey, helper lady? can you stop cryin'? its kinda ruining the mood here"
chain,yeah! that's the spirit! 
simon,"yeah, i'm getting bored of watching this."
helper,he knocked me out of the web! that was close! i think if i had stayed in there any longer i would have totally lost my mind!
simon,waaa~ aait! don't run away! that's so lame!
helper,damn it! i can't believe how weak i've gotten! i should have been able to break out of that illusion spell!
helper,"if i knew it had gotten this bad, i wouldn't have tried confronting spoon."
helper,what a waste of time and energy. i'm really running out of options
helper,i need to just hold on for a bit longer
crimson,celadon? are you ok?
helper,no.
crimson,what happened?
helper,i have to go. bye.
crimson,uh huh. nice talking to you.
helper,where were you?
helper,"what are you, my mother?"
helper,"i don't need to ask you for permission to go on a little stroll. with everything still stuck in lockdown, its not like there's anything else to do"
helper,why do you have that with you?
helper,"this thing is a broken piece of shit, you know that?"
helper,of course it is. its the first one that was built.
helper,its very old and delicate at this point. don't you know how your own body works by now?
helper,"do you want me to be real honest with you, #2? i don't! that's why you're here! i would have never made you on purpose!"
helper,you'd think my stupid body would come with a manual or something! and if one does exist - i sure don't have it! instead i have to push buttons and try to guess what all the stupid colors mean
helper,"ooh an upside down triangle! oooh its red this time! oh look - another me is there! and i can't control it for some reason! oh look, it ran away and brought back a friend that is also me with a blue triangle on the side this time - great! join the club- the more the merrier!"
helper,it seems like every day i understand less and less about myself
helper,"oh, yes. i've noticed."
helper,the first thing i'd do if i had a manual is figure out where you came from and make sure nothing else unexpected crawls on out!
helper,"you seem unusually stressed today, #1."
helper,oh wow nothing gets past you does it?
helper,"say, it would be really nice if you, with all your vast alien knowledge, could tell me how to fix things aroundh ere. because apparently i don't know a damn thin gnext to you, miss..."
helper,"miss ""i have my own spaceship in my mind so i don't even have to deal with youurr hunk of trash!"""
helper,are you asking me for advice?
helper,"either you know more about the helper than i do and refuse to tell me out of sadistic pleasure you have watching me struggle and fuck up. or you don't. and you're just faking this wide-eyed persona to trick me into thinking you're like, more part of the ship than i am. like the real helper alien."
helper,you're lying about something though.
helper,i don't have anything i can tell you that you don't already know. we're running out of fuel and we need someone to release the lockdown by giving the command in obtuse.. and none of the aiguille that are alive will do it.
helper,that's why i left to go try and capture simon.
helper,simon? you wanted simon to say the command? would that even work?
helper,i don't know. but he can speak obtuse
helper,are you sure that's worth the risk? he could end up controlling us instead of the aiguille
helper,"yes, that's why i wanted to capture him first then force him to release us from the lockdown"
helper,i think i'd rather die than fuse with simon.
helper,"and have crimson die too once we run out of fuel? yeah, that's what i thought."
helper,"you can relax though, i'm not going through with that plan. there has to be another option out there. maybe we can just continue to wait for an aiguille to be born that will work with us"
helper,"i'm not sure how long we have left. it could be decades, or maybe only a few years"
helper,"yeah, i'm surprised you haven't tried to leave again."
helper,"you are very weak, i might be able to."
helper,then what's stopping you?
helper,"even if i left, i would still need to eat. the same as you. its far safer being here, i consume less when we all share."
helper,i'm impressed you were able to leave using this. i suppose your connection with crimson allowed for that loophole.
helper,are you crying?
helper,yeah. go ahead and savor it.
rowan,"you're awake! ahaha, it really worked! thank you"
rowan,that was a close one
helper,who are you?
rowan,i'm a friend of yours. you had quite a nasty fall
helper,i did?
rowan,yes. all the way from space!
helper,really? i don't remember a thing
rowan,"that's okay! after an accident like that, its what i expected, but i'll help you get back on your feet again. don't worry, i'll always be at your side."
helper,what's your name?
rowan,rowan aiguille.
helper,and what is that glowing thing?
rowan,"ah, that would be your heart. the source of your energy."
helper,it is?
rowan,"and this right next to your heart, is your brain!"
helper,i'm a computer?
rowan,"oh, no not exactly. see, your heart is very vulnerable on its own without a body. and this computer, which i've called ""the helper"" is like your very own personal assistant!"
rowan,"and life support. like a protective shell! while we're preparing a body that's suitable for you, my dear."
rowan,"your original body is very damaged. it is going to take some time to retrieve the pieces. so this is what i have for you, in the time being."
rowan,hopefully it won't take too long to put you back together again
rowan,"anyway, we have #1, the heart. and #2, the mind."
rowan,"well, i suppose you can order them however you'd like. they're both you, after all!"
rowan,and thiiiss over here is your control helmet! its what you wear to connect yourself to your ship so you can pilot it.
rowan,"you put it on your head like this, see? woo~! cool huh?"
rowan,"you'll be able to transfer an avatar of yourself, to anywhere inside your body - outside too! you can even control multiple bodies at once! all without putting your real physical body in danger."
rowan,all sorts of amazing things!
helper,why? i don't understand. why do i need all this stuff? what ship?
rowan,"yes uh before you fell, we were in the middle of some very important work."
rowan,your ship is another part of you. it was damaged and fell into the ocean. i'll explain it all later.
rowan,i don't want to overload you while you're still recovering
helper,i suppose. i am just very confused
rowan,"my poor dear, i completely understand! i'm just so excited to have you back i can uh, get carried away."
rowan,oh! another friend of yours is here to see you! i'll be right back!
priam,how are you feeling?
helper,fine.
priam,are you in any pain?
helper,no.
rowan,see! i told you it would all work out!
helper,who are you?
priam,my name is priam.
todd,"rowan aiguille. if you really want this cute little science experiment of yours to succeed, i will play your game"
todd,"i will secure your funding, your resources, whatever you need. however. i am going to call upon you for a favor, one day. do you accept that condition?"
todd,wonderful.
helper,i'm scared. why did mr. aiguille take me here?
helper,why do i have to do this? just to get the rest of my body from the ocean? i want to go back to the cabin. where it's safe
todd,what is it saying?
rowan,the helper wants to know if they can ask you a question.
todd,it may.
helper,"during our fight, am i allowed to kill you, sir?"
todd,haha
jester,excuse me? what kind of absurd question is that?!
todd,"sure alien, if you can even lay a hand on me."
rowan,"sir, i'm so sorry for that. there's no need to take things that far"
todd,"shut up, toad."
rowan,"sir, i need to remove the power cables first"
todd,make it quick.
rowan,"helper, you can't say something like that directly to the council. show some restraint with your words."
helper,i can't? but aren't these the bad people who rule the world?
rowan,"yes but, in order to fix your body, we need their money. so we must be polite to them for now."
helper,"if i just killed them all, we can just take their money?"
rowan,"you can't do that. you're not strong enough, they'd just have me killed and priam too. then you'll never be repaired. things aren't always as simple as that."
helper,but he said it was okay? and he laughed! i don't think he'd be angry
rowan,you can't always trust what people say. there would be very serious consequences.
helper,"if i killed the diemind council, then we could rule the world instead and make it better, right? why doesn't rowan understand that"
todd,i am growing tired of waiting. can we get on with it.
todd,"let's see how good you are, helper."
helper,"good? of course i'm good at fighting, that's why i'm here"
helper,yes sir. i'm ready.
todd,then let's begin.
helper,ah!
helper,he knocked my faceplate off! how rude!
aldebaran,hey.. are you winning? hellooo?
helper,"stop! do not distract me right now, aldy!"
aldebaran,how dare you disrespect your king..
helper,water? no! i hate water!
helper,ah! what's happening to me?! i'm unravelling!
todd,"let's play, alien!"
todd,oh? what's this?
helper,i can't move at all! what has he done to me? i'm scared!
aldebaran,oh would you shut up! just throw a punch or something!
helper,ahhhh uahh it hurts it hurts 
aldebaran,ughhh i knew you weren't ready fore a real fight! 
helper,the water! no!
aldebaran,gimme that.
helper,aldy? what're you-
aldebaran,i'm saving your worthleth ass! again!
helper,but-no! you can't take off my helmet in the middle of-
aldebaran,"too bad! whatever happens, i'm sure its better than dying!"
todd,was that all you had in you?
aldebaran,hey! you're not supposed to be able to move right now!
aldebaran,you ruined it! i was going to do something super cool too!
helper,you shouldn't take over my body like that without asking!
aldebaran,why not?
helper,its-its wrong! this is my body!
aldebaran,oh get over it! its not a big deal
aldebaran,"besides, isn't your real body in the bottom of the ocean right now? "
aldebaran,"you're just borrowing this one that rowan made for you. then later, when you're all fixed up, you can just thwow it away. like a piece of garbage"
helper,"just give me back my helmet, aldebaran. please"
helper,ah. how did this happen? why am i here and you're there?
helper,i don't know. but you should come back before it ends up worse.
helper,i should be dead. why am i not dead? what happened? didn't i fall?
helper,we're not dead because our friend rowan saved us. and now we're going to help him save the world from the bad people.
helper,what? no! that's not going to work at all! the plan we made is just stupid kid ideas!

helper,i'm sorry.
helper,"please. come back already we, i shouldn't be separate like this. it doesn't seem right."
helper,"stop, i'm warning you. i'll break you from the inside! is that what you want?"
helper,let me go!
aldebaran,well? did it work?
helper,yes. i feel better now.
rowan,i think you dropped this.
helper,"i did not drop my face plate, rowan. my opponent struck me."
rowan,"haha, yes i saw. you did a very good job in your fight."
helper,i did?
rowan,"yes! you're incredible, helper. i'm so proud of you."
helper,"i only was able to do it because you built me such a strong body, rowan! thank you."
rowan,"i'm glad to hear it, but you're the one who is strong."
helper,am i strong? i don't think i would have won that fight without aldebaran restraining and distracting him
helper,"as long as rowan aiguille is at my side, i don't know why, but i feel like i can do anything."
